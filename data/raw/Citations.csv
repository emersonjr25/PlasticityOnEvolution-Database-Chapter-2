Although there was no effect of incubation temperature or water availability on egg survival, larger females exhibited higher infertility and greater mortality of initially viable eggs, suggesting that reproductive senescence may occur in this long-lived species, Incubation temperature, although it had little influence on size at hatching, significantly affected several measures of growth, including changes in body length, mass, and head dimensions. In general, hatchlings from higher incubation temperatures grew faster during their first year. However, by 16 months of age, growth rates no longer varied among hatchlings incubated at different temperatures. Incubation temperature had no detectable effect on thermal selection by hatchlings at 14 to 16 months of age, as there was no tendency for hatchlings incubated at higher temperatures to preferentially select higher basking temperatures. Moisture levels during incubation did not significantly affect size, growth, or thermoregulatory behavior of hatchlings.

Isometric rested state contractions as well as staircases and steady-state twitches at 20 or 4 min-1 were recorded. While a brief exposure to reduced temperature proved to increase the peak tension of the twitches, without altering the peculiar tension-frequency relation and the pattern of the staircases which characterize the hypodynamic condition, a transitory post-effect of the prolonged hypothermic incubation was noticed, that causes the reappearance of the contractility features which characterize the normal inotropic state. The results are discussed in the light of the double-component hypothesis for the twitch in lizard ventricular cells, and interpreted as evidences that a brief exposure to low temperatures enhances the transmembrane Ca++ influx during the AP, that causes an augmentation of the late, slow rising component of the twitch; while the prolonged hypothermic incubation would cause also an increase of the Ca++ content in a cellular store, and consequently a potentiation of the early, impulsive component of the twitch.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Paper is unavailable1002,Amiel,J.

However, much of the variation in these traits may derive from phenotypically plastic responses to incubation temperature, rather than from underlying genetic variation. Intriguingly, incubation temperature may also influence cognitive traits such as learning ability. Therefore, we might expect correlations between a reptile's size, locomotor speed and learning ability either due to selection on all of these traits or due to environmental effects during egg incubation. In the present study, we incubated lizard eggs (Scincidae: Bassiana duperreyi) under 'hot' and 'cold' thermal regimes and then assessed differences in hatchling body size, running speed and learning ability. We measured learning ability using a Y-maze and a food reward. We found high correlations between size, speed and learning ability, using two different metrics to quantify learning (time to solution, and directness of route), and showed that environmental effects (incubation temperature) cause these correlations. If widespread, such correlations challenge any simple interpretation of fitness advantages due to body size or speed within a population; for example, survivors may be larger and faster than nonsurvivors because of differences in learning ability, not because of their size or speed.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1004,Andrewartha,"S.

Here we measured the incubation temperatures selected by two lineages of triploid parthenogenic geckos in the Heteronotia binoei complex by allowing them to deposit clutches along a thermal gradient. The average nest temperature selected was 28.4 degrees C, with no significant differences between parthenogenic races or individual clones. To investigate the effect of nest-temperature variability on physiological and morphological traits, we incubated eggs from different races at one of four incubation regimes (32 degrees +/- 0 degrees, +/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees, or +/-9 degrees C). Embryos incubated at constant 32 degrees C developed faster than embryos reared under increasing extremes of diel temperature fluctuation (+/-3 degrees, +/-5 degrees C), and incubation at 32 degrees +/- 9 degrees C was unsuccessful.

Our research tested the hypothesis that increased temperature, moisture, or both, are associated with the resumption of development by diapausing embryos of Chamaeleo calyptratus, the veiled chameleon. After 40 days of incubation at 25degreesC in a relatively dry substrate, eggs were subjected to: 1) no change in temperature or moisture, 2) no change in temperature but change from a dry to a wet substrate, 3) change to a warmer temperature but no change in substrate moisture, or 4) an increase in both temperature and substrate moisture. Overall, embryos initiated development after 50-60 days to 80 or more days of incubation. Neither substrate moisture nor water uptake by eggs was related to the interval when development resumed. In contrast, development was initiated about 10 days earlier for eggs in the high temperature treatment compared to eggs in the low temperature treatment.

However, an increase in the length of egg retention is not the only mechanism that would allow squamate embryos to cope with the low ambient temperatures in nests at high elevations or latitudes. We tested the hypothesis that short-term exposure to cold temperatures has less effect on embryonic development of species or populations from cold than warm climates, indicating physiological adaptation of embryos to cold temperatures. Our experimental subjects were four species (five populations) of Sceloporus lizards from a wide range of elevations: Sceloporus scalaris (Arizona, 1460 m) and Sceloporus aeneus (Mexico, 2800 m) from the scalaris species group; and Sceloporus undulatus (Virginia, 600 m) and Sceloporus virgatus (Arizona, low and high elevation populations at 1800 and 2400 m) from the undulatus species group. We incubated eggs under simulated natural temperature regimes, but experimental eggs were exposed to cold (8, 11, 14, or 17 C) for five days to determine the mortality and the delay in hatching relative to control eggs that were incubated under the same simulated natural temperature regimes. The mortality of eggs that were exposed to cold temperatures during incubation did not differ from that of control eggs, and mortality did not vary with elevation. These experimental eggs hatched later than control eggs, but the delay in hatching was again not related to elevation.

We tested these assumptions with observations on the montane lizard Sceloporus virgatus. We measured the diel temperature cycles of gravid females and of nest sites in the field and contrasted the embryonic development of eggs laid at the normal time and eggs retained for an additional 13 d, 20 d, and 30 d in laboratory experiments. The mean temperatures of gravid females and of nest sites were very similar at 25.4 degrees and 25.2 degrees C, respectively Thus, egg retention did not alter the thermal environment of developing embryos of S. virgatus. Moreover, embryonic development was retarded by egg retention; embryos from retained eggs were smaller and less differentiated than control eggs. Egg retention also lengthened the incubation period from 57 d for eggs laid at the normal time to 65 d, 66 d, and 71 d for eggs retained 13 d, 20 d, and 30 d, respectively.

Post-arrest development in the field commenced in April, and hatching occurred in August, for a total incubation period of 10.5 mo. In the laboratory, one group of eggs was incubated at a constant warm (26 degrees C) temperature.

Embryos in the constant warm temperature treatment were in diapause an average of 3 mo, with clutch means ranging from 2 to 4 mo. Hatching among clutches occurred over 2 mo. In contrast, for field and experimental eggs that experienced cold winter conditions, hatching within treatments occurred over 2-14 d; ""winter"" conditions synchronized development. The length of time between the end of cold conditions and hatching did not differ among treatments; development thus resumed as soon as temperature was suitable regardless of the initial period of warm temperature.

To assess whether squamate embryos exhibit adaptive variation in thermal biology, we derived three parameters: an index of developmental rate (DRI), the upper thermal limit for successful incubation, and the lower thermal limit for development for 28 species of lizard and 12 species of snake. The associations between developmental parameters and climatic and life-history variables were examined using both conventional statistics and phylogenetically controlled analyses. Residual DRI (i.e. DRI corrected for stage at oviposition and hatchling mass) was strongly associated with phylogenetic relationship. By contrast, the upper limit for development was negatively related to the amount of precipitation during the warmest quarter of the year, and the lower thermal limit for development was positively related to temperature during the warmest quarter of the year and the activity body temperatures of adults. These latter observations indicate that embryonic thermal physiology is adapted to large-scale environmental patterns, and that global climate change will impact embryonic development directly through impacts on nest temperature per se, as well as indirectly through impacts on the ability of gravid females to select suitable nest sites.

Females in cold environments also nest exclusively in warm, open sites that maximize rates of embryonic growth and development, although this behavior involves risky migrations. Likewise, thermal adaptation of embryonic physiology also promotes growth and development in cold environments. When incubated in the laboratory under shared environmental conditions, embryos from colder environments developed faster and grew more efficiently than embryos from warmer environments, which is a pattern called counter-gradient variation.

We studied the energetics of embryonic development and growth in the lizard Sceloporus undulatus. Eggs were incubated at six constant temperatures, ranging from 28 degrees to 38 degreesC, and embryonic metabolism, incubation period,and body size at hatching were determined. The duration of embryonic development decreased significantly from 55 d at 28 degrees to 40 d at 32 degreesC but did not differ significantly between 32 degrees and 34 degreesC. Embryos incubated at temperatures above 34 degreesC did not survive to hatching. Metabolic rate at specific stages of development (percentage of total incubation period) did not differ among embryos incubated at 28 degrees, 30 degrees, and 34 degreesC. As a result, the total amount of energy expended during the incubation period at 28 degreesC (2.0 kJ) was greater than that at 30 degrees -34 degreesC (1.7-1.8 kJ). However, the difference in energy expenditure did not affect body size at hatching; neither snout-vent length nor body mass varied significantly with incubation temperature, and both were the same as those of hatchlings collected in the field. Thus, there was no apparent , trade-off between hatching date and body size of lizards at hatching. In a natural population in New Jersey, USA, we quantified soil temperatures at potential nesting sites and studied the thermoregulatory, behavior of gravid females to examine the possible consequences of female behaviour for hatching phenotypes. In females and at potential nest sites, embryos would experience temperatures that resulted in high mortality in the laboratory experiment (>32 degreesC). Gravid females had a field body temperature of 33.9 degreesC (95% CI = 0.8 degreesC) and selected a body temperature of 33.3 degreesC (95% CI = 1.9 degreesC) when placed in thermal gradients in the laboratory. Soil temperatures rose above 32 degreesC for several hours each day. Embryos must be able to survive intermittent exposure to temperatures that were lethal under conditions of chronic exposure in the laboratory.

To distinguish the relative importance of these two mechanisms, we quantified the acute and chronic effects of temperature on embryonic metabolism in the eastern fence lizard (Sceloporus undulatus). First, we measured metabolic rates of individual embryos at 27 degrees, 31 degrees, and 34 degrees C. Second, we examined the capacity for thermal acclimation by measuring the metabolic rates of embryos at 30 degrees C, after a period of incubation at either 28 degrees or 32 degrees C.

We tested this prediction by maintaining 67 female garter snakes (Thamnophis elegans) at eight different constant temperatures (21degrees-33degreesC) during pregnancy and making a series of scale counts on their newborn offspring (n=491). To insure that the experimental temperatures were ecologically 491 relevant, we used automated radiotelemetry to record the body temperature of pregnant, free-ranging females. The resulting temperature data allowed us to test the prediction that the inflection points of reaction norms would correspond to the average temperature experienced by embryos in the field. In line with predictions of the Osgood model, reaction norms were flat or U-shaped. In the case of U-shaped reaction norms, the inflection point of the curves corresponded to the average temperature imposed on embryos by free-ranging females. In contrast to some past studies, none of the standard scale scores (ones commonly used in systematics) showed significant temperature effects in either sex. Reaction norms were flat. In contrast, incidences of various abnormalities showed U-shaped reaction norms. Temperature effects were more pronounced in males than in females.

Most research, however, has only considered the effects of constant temperatures, even though developmental temperatures in natural settings fluctuate considerably on a daily and seasonal basis. A laboratory study of 15 clutches of smooth softshell turtles (Apalone mutica) was conducted to explicitly examine the influence of thermal variance on phenotypic variation. Holding mean temperature constant and eliminating substrate moisture effects permitted a clear assessment of the impact of thermal variance on hatching success, incubation length, hatchling body size, swimming speed, and righting time. Incubation length and swimming speed varied significantly among temperature treatments. Both traits tended to increase with increasing thermal variance during embryonic development. Clutch significantly affected all traits examined, except righting time, even after accounting for the effects of initial egg mass. These results highlight the importance of accounting for the impact of both thermal mean and variance on phenotypic variation.

Using the spotted snow skink, Niveoscincus ocellatus, we investigated the ability of females to defer birth if placed into cold conditions at the same time, for 1, 2 or 3 weeks at the end of gestation. The ability to defer birth was compared between two populations at each end of the species' altitudinal range. We hypothesized that females from the high elevation population would be less likely to defer parturition under extended periods of poor conditions, thus ensuring that young were not born too late in the season. In all but the 3-week treatment group from the high elevation population, females were able to defer birth when placed under cold conditions: for all groups, there was no treatment effect on offspring phenotype at birth, dispersal distance or survivorship after release. However, there was a significant negative effect of treatment on offspring growth measured after release, with the results differing between the populations. Females from the high elevation population were less able to defer birth under long periods (3 weeks) of cold conditions, and this was accompanied by a decrease in viability of the offspring.

Ectotherms may be particularly sensitive to changes in thermal regimes, and tropical ectotherms are more likely than temperate species to be influenced by changes in environmental temperature, because they may have evolved narrow thermal tolerances. Keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii) are tropical, oviparous reptiles. To quantify the effects of temperature on the morphology and physiology of hatchling keelbacks, clutches laid by wild-caught females were split and incubated at three temperatures, reflecting the average minimum, overall average and average maximum temperatures recorded at our study site. Upon hatching, the performance of neonates was examined at all three incubation temperatures in a randomized order over consecutive days. Hatchlings from the 'hot' treatment had slower burst swim speeds and swam fewer laps than hatchlings from the cooler incubation temperatures in all three test temperatures, indicating a low thermal optimum for incubation of this tropical species. There were no significant interactions between test temperature and incubation temperature across performance variables, suggesting phenotypic differences caused by incubation temperature did not acclimate this species to post-hatching conditions. Thus, keelback embryos appear evolutionarily adapted to development at cooler temperatures (relative to what is available in their habitat). The considerable reduction in hatchling viability and performance associated with a 3.5 A degrees C increase in incubation temperature, suggests climate change may have significant population-level effects on this species. However, the offspring of three mothers exposed to the hottest incubation temperature were apparently resilient to high temperature, suggesting that this species may respond to selection imposed by thermal regime.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1024,Besson,"A.

A proposal exists to translocate tuatara from Stephens Island in Cook Strait to the Orokonui Ecosanctuary (Te Korowai o Mihiwaka), a coastal site in southern New Zealand. The proposed site is within the former latitudinal range of the genus, but lies outside the current distribution of tuatara, where the climate is warmer. In this study, we examined whether cool incubation temperature is a limiting factor for the proposed reintroduction of tuatara to Orokonui. The tuatara is a species with temperature-dependent sex determination, with only females being produced at low incubation temperatures. Thus, cool southern temperatures may produce only females, even if incubation temperatures are high enough to support successful development. We experimentally translocated tuatara eggs to the ecosanctuary and found that nest temperatures were consistently below those of nests in their current natural distribution and would produce only female hatchlings if successful incubation occurred. An addition of sand to soil did not raise temperatures sufficiently to produce both sexes. However, additional assessments of soil temperatures in a third year indicated that some new sites were warm enough for males to be produced. Given that other aspects of site suitability appear favourable, and that global temperatures are predicted to rise in the near future, which should produce a more viable incubation environment, translocation of this long-lived reptile to the southern ecosanctuary is worth further exploration. However, monitoring of female nesting behaviour, including nest locations, depths and resulting temperatures, will be essential.

Numerous studies examined the effects of incubation temperature or ambient temperature on various aspects of offspring phenotype. We investigated whether incubation temperature and ambient temperature have an interactive effect on offspring performance. Our study animal, the ectothermic vertebrate Lampropholis delicata (common garden skink; De Vis 1888), experiences fluctuating environmental temperatures caused by differential invasion of an exotic plant Vinca major (blue periwinkle). In the laboratory, eggs from wild-caught females were assigned to different incubation temperatures that mimicked variation in natural nests. The feeding performance and digestion time of each hatchling was tested at ambient temperatures that represented environments invaded to different degrees by periwinkle. Incubation and ambient temperature interacted to affect a lizard's mobility, the time that it took to capture, subdue and handle a prey, and the number of handling 'errors' that it made while foraging. For a number of these characteristics, incubation-induced changes to a lizard's mass significantly affected this relationship. Irrespective of size, no interaction effect was found for digestion time: lizards digested food faster at warmer temperatures, regardless of incubation temperature. Thus, temperatures experienced during incubation may alter an animal's phenotype so that the surrounding thermal environment differentially affects aspects of feeding performance. Our results also demonstrate that incubation environment can induce changes to morphology and behaviour that carry over into a lizard's early life, and that in some cases these differences in phenotype interact to affect performance. We suggest that the immediate removal of exotic plants as part of a weed control strategy could have important implications for the foraging performance, and presumably fitness, of ectothermic animals.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1026,Billett,"F.

Cardiovascular function must be critical to this ability. However, information on cardiovascular function in developing reptiles is lacking. Previous work indicated that in reptiles the effects of temperature on growth and metabolism are largely restricted to early development. This study examined whether the previously observed effects of temperature and different perinatal patterns of metabolism observed in amniotic vertebrates are correlated with cardiovascular function. Embryonic and hatchling carcass mass, heart mass and heart rate (HR) were compared for snapping turtle eggs (Chelydra serpentina) incubated at 24 degrees and 29 degrees C.

However, cardiac growth showed a relative decrease as incubation proceeded. Incubation temperature significantly affected the HR pattern during development. The HR of embryos incubated at 24 degrees C was constant for most of incubation (51.8 +/- 4.8 min(-1)). A small decrease was observed just prior to and a large decrease immediately following hatching (posthatch, 22.3 +/- 4.1 min(-1)). At 29 degrees C embryonic HR was greater than at 24 degrees C early in development (72.3 +/- 3 min(-1)). The HR steadily decreased to values equivalent to those at 24 degrees C. The HRs of 24 degrees C and 29 degrees C hatchlings were not different. Cardiac output (estimated as the product of heart mass and HR) increased rapidly during early development and then slowed dramatically at both temperatures.

Hatchlings from eggs incubated at temperatures similar to those in the warmer communal nests hatched faster, were longer, swam faster, were less aggressive, and had fewer scale anomalies than hatchlings from eggs incubated at temperatures similar to those in single nests. A possible disadvantage of communal nests is that eggs in communal nests may be at greater risk to parasitism by Nicrophorus pustulatus (Herschel, 1807).

Parameters such as body size, shape, and lepidosis variation were quantified in 217 adult A. mariarum, belonging to six populations separated by less than 80km. Results showed that significant body size variation was not related to differences among sites in mean annual temperature, but covaried with mean annual precipitation, with the largest individuals occurring in dryer sites. Mark-recapture data obtained from 115 individuals from both the wettest and dryest sites from October 2004 to April 2005 showed that growth rates were higher at the latter. Eight males from each site were captured at the end of the mark-recapture study and reared for two months under identical conditions in a common garden study. Individuals from both sites grew faster when reared in the laboratory with food provided ad libitum. Although growth rates of males from the two populations did not differ significantly in the laboratory, males from the dryest site still maintained a significantly larger asymptotic body size in their growth trajectories. Multivariate analyses also demonstrated that both males and females from the six populations differed in terms of body shape and lepidosis. However, only female body size was found to covary significantly with an environmental gradient (precipitation). A. mariarum does not conform to Bergmann's rule, but the relationship found between mean body size and asympotic growth with mean annual precipitation at these sites needs further analysis. Generally, studies of intra-specific body size variation should consider a number of additional phenotypic traits to provide stronger baseline information on the degree of overall divergence among populations, including those likely to be selectively neutral, before interpreting results of analyses on the body size differences.

Here I overview a recent theoretical model used to predict hatchling sex of reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination. This model predicts that sex ratios will be fairly robust to moderate global warming as long as eggs experience substantial daily cyclic fluctuations in incubation temperatures so that embryos are exposed to temperatures that inhibit embryonic development for part of the day. I also review studies that examine the influence of incubation temperature on posthatch locomotion performance and growth because these are the traits that are likely to have the greatest effect on hatchling fitness. The majority of these studies used artificial constant-temperature incubation, but some have addressed fluctuating incubation temperature regimes.

Due to the dependence of sex determination on incubation temperature, the long-term survival of TSD species may be jeopardized by global climate changes. The current study was designed to assess the degree to which this concern is justified by examining nest-site selection in two species of Pattern II TSD geckos (Eublepharis macularius and Hemitheconyx caudicinctus) and comparing these preferences with those of a species with genotypic sex determination (GSD) (Coleonyx mitratus). Temperature preferences for nest sites were found to be both species-specific and female-specific. While H. caudicinctus females selected a mean nest-site temperature (32.4 degrees) very close to the upper pivotal temperature (32 degrees C) for the species, E. macularius females selected a mean nest-site temperature (28.7 degrees C) well below this species' lower pivotal temperature (30.5 degrees C). Thus, the resultant sex ratios are expected to differ between these two TSD species. Additionally, nest-site temperatures for the GSD species were significantly more variable (SE = +/-0.37) than were temperatures for either of the TSD species (E. macularius SE = +/- 0.10; H. caudicinctus SE = +/-0.17), thereby further demonstrating temperature preferences within the TSD species.

Hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32 degrees C were smaller (snout-vent length, SVL) than those from 26 and 29 degrees C and had smaller mass residuals (from the regression on SVL) as well as shorter tail, head, and femur relative to SVL. Variation in the level of fluctuating asymmetry in meristic and morphometric traits associated with incubation temperatures was quite high but not clearly consistent with the prediction that environmental stress associated with the highest incubation temperatures might produce the highest level of asymmetry. When tested for locomotor capacity in trials developed at body temperatures of 32 and 35 degrees C, hatchlings from the 32 degrees C incubation treatment exhibited the worst performance in any aspect considered (burst speed, maximal length, and number of stops in the complete run). Repeated measures ANCOVAs (with initial egg mass as covariate) of snout-vent length and mass of lizards at days 0 and 20 revealed significant effects of incubation temperature only for mass, being again the hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32 degrees C those exhibiting the smallest final size.

We hypothesized that temperature should differentially affect early incubation stages, in which differentiation dominates over growth, and late incubation stages, characterized by high growth rates. To test this idea, we incubated eggs of wall lizard (Podarcis muralis) under three regimes with the same mean temperature (29 degrees C), one constant and two variable with opposite sequences: first cold (25 degrees C) and then hot (32 degrees C), and vice versa. Hatchlings incubated at high temperature during the initial period had shorter hindlimbs and tails than those incubated under the other two temperature regimes and shorter heads than those incubated initially at low temperature. Thus, temperature experienced by embryos during the early external incubation period produced similar phenotypic responses compared to those reported in previous studies for the same constant temperature applied over the whole incubation period. Because female wall lizards select lower body temperatures during pregnancy, an increase of intrauterine retention would extend the time of exposure of developing embryos to suitable temperatures. Diminution of body temperature during pregnancy is contrary to the expected pattern under the hypothesis that egg retention has evolved to accelerate development, as proposed by the cold-climate model for evolution of viviparity in squamates, and the results of the present study support the alternative hypothesis of developmental optimization as a special case of the broader maternal manipulation view.",N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,NA1049,Brooks,"R.

Intraclutch variation in egg mass had no effect on embryonic mortality. Mass at hatching was correlated with egg mass, but neither variable was related significantly to post-hatching survival or rate of growth. Eggs incubated at the highest temperature produced smaller hatchlings which subsequently grew more slowly than those from eggs incubated at the low and intermediate temperatures.

In the present study, eggs of keelback snakes (Tropidonophis mairii), from a tropical area with strong temporal and spatial variation in soil temperatures and moisture levels, were incubated. The phenotypic traits of hatchling snakes (body size, shape, muscular strength) were affected by moisture content of the incubation medium (vermiculite plus 100% vs. 50% water by mass), by mean incubation temperatures (25.7 vs. 27.9 degrees C) and by diel thermal variation (diel range 6.0 vs. 8.4 degrees C). Interactions between these factors were negligible. Cooler, more thermostable, moister conditions resulted in larger offspring, a trait under strong selection in this population. Thermal and hydric conditions covary in potential nest-sites (e.g. deeper nests are more thermostable as well as moister). This covariation may influence the evolution of reaction norms for embryogenesis. For example, if moister nests enhance offspring fitness and are cooler, then selection will favour the ability to develop in cool as well as moist conditions. Thus, the evolution of optimal incubation conditions with respect to one variable (e.g. temperature) may be driven by patterns of association with another variable (e.g. soil moisture) among natural nest-sites.

In addition, incubation temperature affected hatching and emergence times as well as movement speed and foraging ability. Hatchlings from medium temperature conditions emerged from nests in the field in less time than hatchlings incubated at high or low temperatures, and hatchlings from low temperatures moved slower and were less able to capture and eat mice in the laboratory than hatchlings incubated at medium or high temperatures.

Emerging hatchlings were exposed to one of five conditions: (1) hawk model, (2) white head model. with no facial features, (3)white head model with black eyes, (4) a person, or (5) a vibration without a visual stimulus. I tested the null hypotheses of no differences in response as a function of predator type or incubation temperature. Emergence behaviour when undisturbed was affected by incubating temperature, and antipredatory behaviour was affected by both predator type and incubation temperature. Pine snake hatchlings responded more protectively (withdrawal into tunnels) than defensively (striking), responded with less intensity to a vibration compared with visual predator stimuli, and required longer to respond to a head model without eyes than to all other predator types. Given the relatively small size of hatchlings, it is adaptive for them to withdraw into the nest rather than attack a predator. Hatchlings from eggs that were incubated at medium temperatures required less time to emerge from their underground nests when undisturbed, and had stronger protective responses than snakes incubated at other temperatures.

Our phylogeny includes 32 of the 33 extant described New Zealand skink species (Cyclodina and Oligosoma), the Lord Howe Island skink (C. lichenigera), and representatives from several New Caledonian genera. Neighbour-joining, Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood, and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses are used to demonstrate that the New Zealand skink species form a single monophyletic lineage, with C. lichenigera representing a closely related sister lineage to the New Zealand radiation. Our relaxed molecular clock analyses indicate that skinks colonised New Zealand in the early Miocene (16-22.6 mya), shortly after the 'Oligocene drowning' event (similar to 25 mya). We propose that skinks reached New Zealand from New Caledonia via long-distance overwater dispersal, with C. lichenigera persisting on volcanic islands along the Lord Howe Rise and Norfolk Ridge. Eight major genetic clades are evident within the New Zealand skink fauna, with the divergences among these clades during the early to mid-Miocene resulting in distinct open habitat, forest, and coastal radiations. Subsequent diversification in the late Miocene-Pliocene appears to coincide with tectonic activity along the Alpine Fault and the uplift of the Southern Alps.

Incubation length, proportion of hatchling reaching complete development and hatchling sex were determined at hatching. Nest temperatures exhibited a cyclic daily fluctuation due to solar radiation, which is the major heat source for nests. Clutch temperature was relatively stable and its daily amplitude was negatively correlated with clutch depth and size. Rainfall was the major source of clutch temperature decrease. Clutch and metabolic temperatures increased significantly during incubation. A small sample size failed to demonstrate a statistical relationship between length of incubation and mean clutch temperature. Proportion of embryos reaching complete development depended on maximum and minimum clutch temperature, maximum daily amplitude of clutch temperature and maximum decrease in clutch temperature on a period <= 4 day.

Since temperature decreases with altitude, the upper altitudinal limit of some lowland species could be related to the temperature requirement for embryogenesis. The endemic grass lizard Takydromus stejnegeri is widely distributed at altitudes below 1000 m in Taiwan. In this study, we examined the thermal effects on embryogenesis of this species and evaluated its potential influence on current altitudinal distribution of T stejnegeri. We measured some indices of embryogenesis and hatchling after incubation at 5 constant temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, and 33 degrees C). The results revealed that (1) hatching success increased with temperatures from 15 degrees C to 20 degrees C, reached 100% at 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, and then declined at 33 degrees C; and (2) the incubation duration increased with decreasing temperatures. Based on polynomial regression analysis, we predicted the development of embryos would cease at 16 degrees C. Comparing the monthly average temperature at 3 different altitudes, we found that the T stejnegeri would have an incubation success <100 % at areas higher than 1000 m (monthly average soil temperature < 25 degrees C), and its eggs would not have enough time to hatch in the areas above 1600 m.

While 53 (88.3 %) lizards successfully completed the training phase, 14 (46.7 %) of the 'hot' incubated and none of the 'cold' incubated lizards successfully completed the instrumental task. Thirteen of these lizards rapidly learnt to discriminate colours, and this culminated in eight individuals successfully completing a choice reversal. Hatchling B. duperreyi demonstrated surprisingly rapid learning, and these results highlight the potentially important role of cognition during development and ultimately, in fitness.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1083,Clarke,D.

Furthermore, most previous studies on the effects of climate change utilized a model of uniform annual change, which assumes that temperature increases are symmetric on diurnal or seasonal time scales. In this study, we simulated observed trends in the asymmetric alteration of diurnal temperature range by increasing night-time temperatures experienced by female lizards during their ovarian cycle as well as by the resulting eggs during their incubation. We found that higher night-time temperatures during the ovarian cycle increased the probability of reproductive success and decreased the duration of the reproductive cycle, but did not affect embryo stage or size at oviposition, clutch size, egg mass or relative clutch mass. Furthermore, higher incubation temperatures increased hatchling size and decreased incubation period but had no effect on incubation success. Subsequent hatchlings were more likely to survive winter if they hatched earlier, though our sample size of hatchlings was relatively small. These findings indicate that higher night-time temperatures mainly affect rate processes and that certain aspects of life history are less directly temperature dependent. As our findings confirm that climate warming is likely to increase the rate of development as well as advance reproductive phenology, we predict that warmer nights during the breeding season will increase reproductive output as well as subsequent survival in many temperate ectotherms, both of which should have positive fitness effects.",Partially,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Pre-oviposition temperatures manipulated but incubation temperatures constant.1084,Trullas,S.

In this study, temperature, oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures (PO2 and PCO2) of in situ nests as well as nests relocated into a hatchery with clean sand were monitored throughout incubation. Hatching success of hatchery nests was significantly higher than in situ nests (83.1 vs. 21.6X,) and mainly resulted from higher mortality of early-stage embryos. During the first half of incubation, temperature and PCO2 were higher (by 0.6 degrees C and 0.7 kPa, respectively) and PO2 was lower (by 1.1 kPa) within in situ relative to hatchery nests. Because embryo metabolism does not interfere significantly with nest gas contents during the first half of incubation, these results suggest that the greater content of organic matter and/or microorganisms in the sand surrounding in situ nests had an effect on nest gas contents. As PO2 and PCO2 differences were relatively small, microbial activity (such as fungal and bacterial infection) may have caused the early embryo mortality found in situ. Moreover, our results suggest that during the second half of incubation, neither PO2 nor PCO2 reached threshold levels that resulted in the death of embryos or hatchlings. Overall, this study showed a clear benefit of using clean sand to increase hatchling production in arribada beaches and highlights the importance of further investigating the relationship between nest micro-environment, sand microbial activity and embryo development under natural conditions during these unique nesting events.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,"Nesting study, not an incubation study"1085,Congdon,"J.

Multivariate analysis of hatchling characteristics revealed that maternal effects and incubation temperatures during the final third of development appear to have major impact on hatchling characteristics. Based on these results, the ''decision'' to produce primarily male or female offspring would first be based on characteristics of the female parent and secondarily on the nest temperatures influenced by nest site selection.

However, factors other than sex chromosomes and the consequent sex-typical gonadal hormone secretions may play important roles in the differentiation of the neural mechanisms underlying individual and sex differences in aggressive and sexual behavior. The leopard gecko, like many oviparous reptiles, lacks sex chromosomes. Instead, gonadal sex is determined by temperature during embryogenesis, with low and high incubation temperatures producing females and intermediate temperatures producing mixed sex ratios. In essence, this allows for the study of individual and sex differences without the confounding variable of genetically determined gender. Experiments have shown that the temperature experienced during incubation plays a critical role in establishing the adult morphological, endocrinological, and behavioral phenotype. In this experiment, the independent effects of incubation temperature and gonadal sex on the morphology and metabolic capacity of specific brain nuclei were determined. Both individual and sex differences in the volume of the preoptic area and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus are determined primarily by incubation temperature, not by gonadal sex. However, incubation temperature and gonadal sex are both important in determining the metabolic capacity in the anterior hypothalamus, external amygdala, dorsal lateral nucleus of the hypothalamus, dorsal lateral nucleus of the thalamus, dorsal ventricular ridge, habenula, lateral hypothalamus, nucleus rotundus, nucleus sphericus, periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, preoptic area, periventricular nucleus of the preoptic area, septum, striatum, torus semicircularis, and ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus.

First, by viewing variation as categorical rather than continuous, and second, by not placing sufficient emphasis on the fact that males and females differ genetically in many vertebrates, environmental contributions to individual differences cannot be distinguished from genetic contributions, dust as there are two levels of organization of sex, so, too, are there two levels of organization of the sexual phenotype, Primary organization is the process of sexual differentiation that follows gonadal determination and is manifest as the morphological, physiological and behavioral aspects of the sexual phenotype. There is a second, and subsequent, level of organization, however, that is directly related to primary organization and is the basis of individual variation in sexually dimorphic behaviors. This level can be termed secondary organization, Because individual variation is the substance of evolutionary change, understanding its organization will require both new paradigms and alternative animal model systems that allow separation of the effects of genes and hormones from environmental and experimental stimuli. The plasticity of the sexual phenotype and how each individual emerges from its own unique circumstances integrates these different levels of organization, As might be predicted, recent research suggests that the relationship between primary and secondary organization and the development of individual differences in sociosexual behaviors involves more than just sex steroid hormones.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Review paper1088,Crews,D.

In TSD sex determination is an ''all or none'' process and intersexes are rarely formed. How is the external signal of temperature transduced into a genetic signal that determines gonadal sex and channels sexual development? Studies with the red-eared slider turtle have focused on the physiological, biochemical, and molecular cascades initiated by the temperature signal. Both male and female development are active processes-rather than the organized/default system characteristic of vertebrates with genotypic sex determination-that require simultaneous activation and suppression of testis- and ovary-determining cascades for normal sex determination. It appears that temperature accomplishes this end by acting on genes encoding for steroidogenic enzymes and steroid hormone accepters and modifying the endocrine microenvironment in the embryo. The temperature experienced in development also has long-term functional outcomes in addition to sex determination. Research with the leopard gecko indicates that incubation temperature as well as steroid hormones serve as organizers in shaping the adult phenotype, with temperature modulating sex hormone action in sexual differentiation. Finally, practical applications of this research have emerged for the conservation and restoration of endangered egg-laying reptiles as well as the embryonic development of reptiles as biomarkers to monitor the estrogenic effects of common environmental contaminants.

Many reptiles lack sex chromosomes, relying instead on the temperature of incubation to determine sex. In the leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius), an incubation temperature of 26 degrees C produces all females, whereas 32.5 degrees C results in mostly males. Incubation temperature is the primary determinant of differences both within and between the sexes in growth, physiology, and sociosexual behavior, as well as the volume and metabolic capacity of specific brain nuclei. To determine if incubation temperature organizes the brain directly rather than via gonadal sex hormones, the gonads of male and female leopard geckos from the two incubation temperatures were removed and, in some instances, animals were given exogenous testosterone. In vertebrates with sex chromosomes, the size of sexually dimorphic nuclei are sensitive to hormone levels in adulthood, but in all species studied to date, these changes are restricted to the male. Therefore, after behavior tests, morphometrics of certain limbic and nonlimbic brain areas were determined. Because nervous system tissue depends on oxidative metabolism for energy production and the level of cytochrome oxidase activity is coupled to the functional level of neuronal activity, cytochrome oxidase histochemistry also was performed on the same brains. Hormonal manipulation had little effect on the volume of the preoptic area or ventromedial hypothalamus in geckos from the all-female incubation temperature, but significantly influenced the volumes of these brain areas in males and females from the male-biased incubation temperature. A similar relationship was found for cytochrome oxidase activity of the anterior hypothalamus, amygdala, dorsal ventricular ridge, and septum. The only sex difference observed was found in the ventromedial hypothalamus; males showed no significant changes in cytochrome oxidase activity with hormonal manipulation, but females from both incubation temperatures were affected similarly. The results indicate that incubation temperature organizes the brain directly rather than via hormones arising from its sex-determining function. This is the first demonstration in a vertebrate that factors other than steroid hormones can modify the organization and functional activity of sexually differentiated brain areas.

Because males and females differ genetically as well as hormonally, it would be valuable to distinguish the contribution of sex-specific genes from hormones. In addition, since animals age as they gain sociosexual experience, but do not necessarily gain sociosexual experience as they age, it is important to separate the effects of age from those attributable to experience. The leopard gecko is a lizard lacking sex chromosomes, depending instead upon the temperature during incubation to establish gonadal sex, This effectively removes sex-specific genetic influences from any study of sexual differentiation. Eggs were incubated at either 26 degrees C or 32.5 degrees C, temperatures that produce only female hatchlings or a male-biased sex ratio, respectively. By raising geckoes in isolation and then housing some animals together in breeding groups at different ages after they attained sexual maturity, it was possible to assess the relative effects of age and sociosexual experience on the volume and metabolic capacity of limbic and non-limbic brain areas. In general, males showed more changes compared to females. For example, there was a decrease with age in the volume of the preoptic area and the ventromedial hypothalamus in males, but not in females. Both age and sociosexual experience influenced cytochrome oxidase activity in these and other brain areas. Experienced animals had greater metabolic capacity in nuclei functionally associated with sociosexual behavior in Lizards and other vertebrates. For example, cytochrome oxidase activity was higher in the anterior hypothalamus of males, in the ventromedial hypothalamus of both males and females from the male-biased incubation temperature, and in the preoptic area of females from both incubation temperatures. These differences were not paralleled by differences in circulating levels of sex hormones; only plasma androgen levels differed as a function of experience in males. These data suggest that the volume and metabolic capacity of specific brain regions change as animals age and gain sociosexual experience, but the nature and degree of change depend upon prenatal events.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1092,Crews,"D.

In this species, as in many other reptiles, incubation temperature of the egg determines gonadal sex. At higher incubation temperatures females are produced and increasing temperature appears to increase estrogen production in the embryonic brain. Treatment of eggs incubating at a male-producing temperature with exogenous estrogen causes ovaries to form. At a female-biased incubation temperature, prevention of estrogen biosynthesis or administration of nonaromatizable androgens results in the development of testes. In mammals, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1) regulates most genes required for estrogen biosynthesis, including aromatase. In both mammals and red-eared sliders, SF-1 is differentially expressed in males and females during gonadogenesis. We have examined both SF-1 gene expression and aromatase activity in embryos incubating at different temperatures and after manipulation to change the course of gonadal development. Our findings indicate a central role for SF-1 in enacting the effect of estrogen. Estrogen treatment directly or indirectly downregulates SF-1 and, ultimately, causes development of females. The inhibition of estrogen results in upregulation of SF-1 and male hatchlings. Thus, SF-1 may lie at the center of one molecular crossroad in male versus female differentiation of the red-eared slider. J. Exp. Zool. 290:597-606, 2001.

We argue that the study of behavioural development should combine both proximate and ultimate approaches, and can help to understand how early subtle environmental factors shape consistent individual variation both between and within sexes. This is illustrated by reviewing the profound effects of incubation temperature on the development of brain and social behaviour in the leopard gecko, a species with temperature-dependent sex determination, and the effects of early exposure to steroid hormones on social behaviour in rodents and especially birds. Both are maternal effects: incubation temperature can be partly determined by the nest site where the mother deposited her eggs, while in both oviparous and viviparous vertebrates maternal hormones reach and influence the embryo. In the gecko, incubation temperature affects sexual and aggressive behaviour, growth, the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, as well as the size, connectivity and metabolic capacity of certain brain areas. In this way not only is the gonad type determined, but so too is the morphological, physiological, neural, and behavioural phenotype established that explains much of within-sex variation. In rodents, maternal hormones affect similar aspects. In avian species, maternal hormones, deposited in the eggs, vary systematically between and within clutches and have both short- and long-lasting effects on competitive behaviour. Evidence suggests that mothers adaptively adjust hormone allocation to the environmental context. In addition, we discuss some effects of postnatal experience on behavioural development in geckos, mice and bird species.

On the other hand, evolutionary biologists have long commented on the relationship between growth and reproduction in many species, yet have generally neglected the mechanisms underlying such complex traits. An approach that integrates the multiple proximate levels promises to provide significant insight into the evolution of neuroendocrine control mechanisms. In this chapter, we take this approach in reviewing environmental influences on growth and reproduction in the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius. In this species, incubation temperature during embryonic development not only determines gonadal sex, but also underlies within-sex differences in growth, adult morphology, aggressiveness, reproductive physiology and behaviour, and brain organization. Thus, the leopard gecko is an excellent model to elucidate the developmental interactions among the environment and the endocrine and nervous systems that control growth and reproduction.

Original experiments on the effects of incubation at 30<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C (100% females) or 33<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C (100% males) on development in Alligator mississippiensis are described. These include an investigation of the effect of exposing embryos briefly to a different incubation temperature on the sex ratio at hatching, and a study of the effects of 30<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C and 33<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C on growth and development of alligator embryos and gonads. A 7-day pulse of one temperature on the background of another was insufficient to alter the sex ratio dramatically. Incubation at 33<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C increased the rate of growth and development of alligator embryos. In particular, differentiation of the gonad at 33<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C was enhanced compared with 30<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C. A hypothesis is developed to explain the mechanism of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) in crocodilians. The processes of primary sex differentiation are considered to involve exposure to a dose of some male-determining factor during a specific quantum of developmental time during early incubation. The gene that encodes for the maledetermining factor is considered to have an optimum temperature (33<latex>$^\circ$</latex>C). Any change in the temperature affects the expression of this gene and affects the dose or quantum embryos are exposed to. In these cases there is production of females by default. The phylogenetic implications of TSD for crocodilians, and reptiles in particular, are related to the life history of the animal from conception to sexual maturity. Those animals that develop under optimal conditions grow fastest and largest and become male. A general association between the size of an animal and its sex is proposed for several types of vertebrate.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Data not available in paper1103,DeGregorio,B. A. DeGregorio and A. S.

All sea turtles display temperature-dependent sex determination, with cooler nests producing males and warmer nests producing females. Analysis of the factors that affect incubation temperatures provides insight into variation in hatchling sex ratios over temporal and spatial scales and may help to guide management measures for the imperiled loggerhead sea turtle. Although no temperature difference was detected between relocated and in situ clutches during the thermal sensitive period, relocated nests hatched more quickly and incubated at warmer temperatures than in situ clutches for the entire incubation period. Metabolic heating was apparent in all clutches, beginning during the middle third of incubation, with the greatest gradient between nest temperature and surrounding sand temperatures ((x) over bar = 1.5 +/- 0.05 degrees C) that occur during the final third of incubation. The magnitude of metabolic heating was not different between relocated and in situ clutches. Diel temperature fluctuations within nests were significantly less pronounced than in adjacent sand, which implies a degree of thermal buffering within the nest chamber. During the thermosensitive period, all nests incubated at a mean temperature above that of the estimated pivotal temperature (29.2 degrees C), which implies a strongly female-biased hatchling sex ratio during the portion of the nesting season monitored. Potential impacts on incubation temperature and resultant sex ratios should be considered and explored on a beach-by-beach basis before adopting nest relocation as a conservation measure.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,NA1104,Delmas,"V.

For oviparous sauropsid species, temperature within the nest influences gonadal sexual differentiation during a small window of embryogenesis called the thermosensitive period (TSP). The absence of sexual dimorphic characteristic in juveniles of TSD species coupled with the lack of a non-invasive method to determine sex is a great obstacle to studies estimating sex-ratios under natural conditions. Some authors have proposed proxies of sex-ratio obtained through correlative approaches. They commonly extrapolate the empirical profile of sex-ratios as a function of constant incubation temperature established for several species in the laboratory to a field context. However, most of these proxies have been refuted by studies realized under field conditions, and consequently they cannot be used to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. Here, we propose a new thermal model of TSD using a mechanistic approach. We built this model from a collection of published data of physiological processes (i.e. the growth of the embryo, the growth of gonads and the activity of the enzyme aromatase) underlying the TSD mechanism, for the European pond turtle (Emys orbicularis). This new approach provides integration of incubation temperature fluctuations, as well as the cumulative and differential effect of high and low temperatures on sexual differentiation to embryo sex determination. The significant consistency obtained between observed and predicted sex-ratios both at diverse constant and fluctuating incubation temperatures provides hope to develop an efficient method to predict sex-ratio under natural conditions. The reliable validity of this new model could have wide-ranging implications for the understanding of the TSD mechanism, as well as its evolutionary and ecological consequences in natural populations.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,NA1105,Delmas,"V.

As realistic measures of fitness are usually difficult to perform directly, integrating fitness indices are proposed in all taxa. In sauropsids, locomotor performances have been proposed as a good integrating index of fitness in natural populations. Concerning aquatic turtles, a performance trait that may be important for the survival of juveniles is the righting response of individuals when they are placed on their carapace. In the present study, we examined the righting response in juveniles of the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta elegans. We tested two different measures of the righting response for 170 juveniles from constant incubation temperature and for 86 juveniles from three sinusoidal fluctuating incubation temperatures that are considered as more representative of natural conditions in the nest. We compared the effects of offspring sex, maternal identity, juvenile growth rate, and juvenile survival (i.e. individual characteristics), as well as the nutritional status of juveniles (i.e. experimental conditions), on the two different measures of righting response and for each thermal incubation treatments of the eggs (i.e. experimental treatments). We observed that the effects of the individual characteristics were markedly different between the two measures of the righting response and between experimental treatments. These results highlight the importance of the choice of the measure and of the experimental conditions and treatments in the study of a phenotypic trait. Results obtained for only one performance measure under constant laboratory conditions must therefore be extrapolated to the field with caution. Our results also show that the righting response presents individual variability that is probably heritable and is indirectly correlated with survival. These findings support the validity of the righting response as a good candidate for a fitness index in aquatic turtles.

The influence of fluctuating nest temperatures has been experimentally examined in different reptile species; however, similar experiments using moisture as the key variable are lacking. In this article, we examine the effect of various substrate moisture regimes during incubation on different traits (egg mass, incubation length, and hatchling mass) in a chelonian species with flexible-shelled eggs, the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans). Our results show that the rate of water uptake by the eggs was higher in wet than in dry substrate and varied across development. More important, during the first third of development, the egg mass changes were relatively independent of the soil moisture level; they became very sensitive to moisture levels during the other two-thirds. Moreover, hydric conditions exerted a strong influence on the eggs' long-term sensitivity to the moisture of the substrate. Even short-term episodes of high or low levels of moisture modified permanently their water sensitivity, notably through modification of eggshell shape and volume, and in turn entailed significant effects on hatchling mass (and hence offspring quality).

Furthermore, since most experiments utilize constant temperature incubation treatments to explore phenotypic response to temperature, few studies have addressed the consequences of incubation under natural conditions. In this study I utilized constant-temperature laboratory incubations and natural-nest incubations to determine the effects of temperature on sex, size, growth, and locomotor performance in the tortoise Gopherus polyphemus. Constant-temperature incubations do induce substantial growth and performance variation in these tortoises. However, the data do not clearly support the differential-fitness hypothesis because (i) growth variation does not result in adult size dimorphism, (ii) performance differences are confined to a very short period after hatching, and (iii) natural incubation temperatures do not vary sufficiently to produce significant phenotypic variation in traits other than sex.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1108,Desouza,R.

However, the site of estrogen synthesis in two species of freshwater turtles is unclear. InæEmys orbicularisæ, estrogens were shown to be produced by the gonads, whereas inTrachemys scripta, gonadal steroids were not detected. The marine turtleæDermochelys coriaceaæexhibits TSD but in gonadal development, ovarian differentiation is delayed. Gonadal aromatase activity and estrogen content in this species were measured in embryos incubated at 27Á and in embryos incubated at 30.5Á, respectively, masculinizing and feminizing temperatures within the range of temperatures found in natural nests. At all stages studied, aromatase activity was present and found to be higher at 30.5Á than at 27Á. Estrogens were only found at 30.5Á. The effects of temperature shifts on gonadal aromatase activity were then examined. Eggs were shifted from 27 to 35Á (feminizing temperature) at different embryonic stages and exposed to 35Á for 6 days. An increase in gonadal aromatase activity, although with significant individual variations, was seen only when eggs were shifted between stages 23 and 27. These stages are in the range of the thermosensitive stages for sexual differentiation of the gonads determined in other turtles. These results are similar to those previously obtained inæE. orbicularisæand agree with a key role for endogenous estrogens in gonadal differentiation of reptiles with TSD.

Production of oestrogens appears to play a key role in this phenomenon. Gonadal aromatase activity was measured in embryos incubated at 25-degrees-C (masculinizing temperature) and at 30-degrees-C (feminizing temperature). At the beginning of the thermosensitive period, the aromatase activity was low at both temperatures but was somewhat higher at 30 than at 25-degrees-C. Afterwards, it remained low in differentiating testes at 25-degrees-C, whereas it increased in differentiating ovaries at 30-degrees-C to form a marked peak when germ cells underwent meiotic prophase. Eggs were shifted either from 25 to 30-degrees-C (highly feminizing) or from 30 to 35-degrees-C for 6 days at different stages of embryonic development. The 25-35-degrees-C shifts performed during the thermosensitive period strongly increased the aromatase activity but were ineffective after this period. The 30-35-degrees-C shifts increased the aromatase activity at all stages. Altogether, results indicate that, in differentiating gonads of turtle embryos, temperature acts on the regulation of synthesis (and therefore activity) of cytochrome P-450 aromatase (P-450-aro).

Oestrogens have been shown to be involved in this phenomenon and temperature has been expected to act, directly or indirectly, on regulation of synthesis or activity of cytochrome P-450 aromatase (P-450 arom). We have studied the effects of temperature shifts and of exposure at female- or male-producing temperatures for different times on gonadal aromatase activity and gonadal structure. In a first series of experiments, eggs were incubated at 25-degrees-C (masculinizing temperature) up to stage 18 and then exposed for 1 to 8 days at 35-degrees-C, a highly feminizing temperature. The response was exponential: aromatase activity increased clearly only after 4 day exposure at 35-degrees-C, then it was considerably enhanced. After 1 and 2 days at 35-degrees-C, the structure of gonads was not modified. With longer exposures at 35-degrees-C, gonads were progressively feminized: medullary epithelial cords disappeared, whereas an ovarian cortex was forming. In another type of experiment, eggs incubated at 30-degrees-C (feminizing temperature) until stage 19 were transferred at 25-degrees-C for 6 days. In embryos of these shifted eggs, gonadal aromatase activity was about ninefold lower than that in control embryos (maintained at 30-degrees-C). However, this activity did not fall to the level measured in embryos of the same stage incubated at 25-degrees-C from egg-laying and was about twofold higher than that measured at the time of transfer. Gonads exhibited a cortex anlage but the medulla was more voluminous than that of controls and epithelial cords were beginning to form within. Together these results show that changes in gonadal aromatase activity and in gonadal structure are correlated, and that temperature acts on regulation of P-450 arom synthesis.

We investigated the effect of incubation temperature and androgen implantation on aspects of the dopaminergic system of T-f and T-m males. Our data suggest that more dopamine (DA) is stored in the nucleus accumbens of naive T-f males compared with naive T-m males when they encounter a receptive female conspecific across a barrier. No difference was measured in the preoptic area and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). This difference in intracellular DA levels in a motivation related brain nucleus might be correlated with differences in sociosexual behavior observed between the two morphs. There were no differences in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressing cell numbers in the VTA of cholesterol (CH)-implanted naive castrated T-f and T-m males. Only T-f males implanted with testosterone had significantly higher TH immunopositive cell numbers in the VTA compared with CH- and dihydrotestosterone-implanted T-f males.

Incubation time was mainly explained by differences between lineages, but it was also influenced by population and female effects. Within each lineage, incubation was shorter at cooler and wetter sites, and for a given climate it was shorter for eastern than for western populations, suggesting that countergradient variation has evolved independently in the two lineages. Female size, clutch size, and relative fecundity were primarily influenced by inter-population differences, a pattern that seemed attributable to environmental differences in productivity, because mean female size was positively correlated with a gradient of increasing precipitation and decreasing temperature. Clutch size was mainly, but not entirely, dependent on female SVL, suggesting both a proximate effect of local conditions and intrinsic differences among populations. Females from drier and warmer sites produced larger hatchlings. Mean egg mass was mainly determined by familial effects.

Two aspects of temperature sensitivity were evaluated in the Red-Eared Slider, Trachemys scripta: (1) clutch-specific variation in sex ratios produced at pivotal temperature and (2) variation in clutch sex ratios produced over the nesting season (e.g., early nesting season, midnesting season, late nesting season). Relatively large numbers of clutch sex ratios were examined from two or three time periods (e.g., early nesting season, midnesting season, late nesting season), during each of three nesting seasons. The results indicate that pivotal temperatures vary significantly among clutches, with clutch sex ratios ranging from all male to all female when incubated near the putative pivotal temperature. The results on seasonal variation in clutch sex ratios were more ambiguous. Data from two of the nesting seasons do not reveal significant variation between time periods. During the third nesting season, sex ratios from the first two time periods were not significantly different from one another, but the sex ratios from the very end of the nesting season were significantly different from those of the two earlier time periods. In summary, the results reveal a clutch-specific variation in pivotal temperatures, but the results from the seasonal study of sex ratios did not consistently reveal a shift in sex ratios over each nesting season.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Only one incubation temperature was used1122,Dodge,"C.

When oestrone or oestradiol were injected into eggs incubated at 25Á C just before or at the beginning of the thermosensitive period, the gonads differentiated into ovaries instead of testes. Conversely, when tamoxifen was injected, at the same stages, into eggs incubated at 30Á C, epithelial cords or tubes, similar to potential seminiferous cords, differentiated in the interior part of the gonads. However, an ovarian-like cortex persisted at their surface. At 25Á C, treatment with tamoxifen or with both tamoxifen and oestradiol also resulted in differentiation of ovotestes. These experiments show that tamoxifen binding to oestrogen receptors prevented the inhibitory action of oestrogens on testicular cord development. Maintenance (at 30Á C) or development (at 25Á C) of ovarian cortex in the presence of tamoxifen can be expected from an agonistic action of this drug, as already described. Preliminary data on steroid content in the gonads indicate that, during the early stages of the thermosensitive period, the level of estrogens is higher at 30Á C than at 25Á C. It is proposed that in species displaying temperature sensitivity for the sexual differentiation of gonads, temperature acts on the processes regulating the synthesis or the activity of cyto-chrome-P450 aromatase.",N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,NA1125,Dorizzi,"M.

The thermosensitive period (TSP) lies between embryonic stages 16 and 22. Gonadal differentiation begins during this period involving oestrogens. Treatment with oestrogens during TSP results in the differentiation of ovaries at a male-producing temperature (25Á C), whereas treatment with an antioestrogen (tamoxifen) or with nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors results in gonadal masculinization at a female-producing temperature (30Á C). The present study examines the effects on the ovary of inhibiting aromatase activity after TSP. Eggs of E. orbicularis incubated at 30Á C were given five or seven applications of 10 _g aromatase inhibitor Letrozole (CGS 20267) in ethanol, between stages 22+ and 24_25 when ovarian aromatase activity strongly increases. Individuals which received five applications were sacrificed at stages 24+_25. Those which received seven applications were sacrificed either at stage 25+ (close to hatching), or 34_36 days after hatching. Gonadal aromatase activity and related gonadal structure were studied in each individual. In the three series, the gonadal aromatase activity in individuals treated with Letrozole varied from similar or close to that in controls to much lower, and the gonadal structure varied from ovary-like to ovotestis. Ovotestes had the lowest levels of aromatase activity, under 4 fmoles/h/gonad, close to testis levels. They were found in 7 out of 26 individuals given Letrozole. Besides ovotestes, gonads presenting various degrees of masculinization, with enlarged epithelial cords and lacunae in the medulla, were found. Therefore, by inhibiting aromatase activity and thus estrogen synthesis, we were able to obtain the differentiation of testis-like cords or tubes in ovaries of E. orbicularis, after the period of temperature sensitivity. These results show that the ovary retains male potential after this period. Thus, besides their implication during the critical embryonic period for gonadal sex differentiation, oestrogens play a role in maintaining the ovarian structure after this period. A decrease in oestrogen levels could explain some other cases of ovarian masculinization known in vertebrates.",N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,NA1126,Downes,S. J. Downes and R.

Vulnerability to predation is one plausible way that phenotypic shifts could affect an organism's fitness. We incubated the eggs of three sympatric lizard species at temperatures similar to the thermal extremes of natural nests, and measured several traits that are likely to influence a hatchling's susceptibility to a natural (snake) predator. We also examined the lizards' actual vulnerability to snake predators in direct encounters in the laboratory. Our results show that incubation temperature can affect an individual's date of hatching, morphology, locomotor performance, chemosensory responses to snake scent, and ability to avoid a snake predator during staged laboratory encounters. Incubation temperature did not modify the hatchling's 'attractiveness' to snakes (as measured via chemical cues) or its antipredator tactics (propensity to escape predation through fleeing or caudal autotomy). The magnitude and direction of incubation-induced phenotypic shifts varied among the three species (even those with similar life histories, thermoregulatory preferences, and microhabitat requirements), and depended on body temperatures and hatchling age. We conclude that incubation-induced modifications to a lizard's phenotype affect a suite of traits that are likely to influence its vulnerability, and also its actual ability to escape from a predator. This result suggests that incubation regimes can influence organismal fitness via their effects on predator-prey interactions.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1127,Du,W. G. Du and X.

Most investigations, however, have only considered the effects of constant temperatures. We incubated eggs of Takydromus septentrionalis (Lacertidae) at constant (24 degrees C, 27 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 33 degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures to determine the effects of these thermal regimes on incubation duration, hatching success and hatchling traits (morphology and locomotor performance). Hatching success at 24 degrees C and 27 degrees C was higher, and hatchlings derived from these two temperatures were larger and performed better than their counterparts from 30 degrees C and 33 degrees C. Eggs incubated at fluctuating temperatures exhibited surprisingly high hatching success and also produced large and well-performed hatchlings in spite of the extremely wide range of temperatures (11.6-36.2 degrees C) they experienced. This means that exposure of eggs to adversely low or high temperatures for short periods does not increase embryonic mortality. The variance of fluctuating temperatures affected hatchling morphology and locomotor performance more evidently than did the mean of the temperatures in this case. The head size and sprint speed of the hatchlings increased with increasing variances of fluctuating temperatures.

Experimental manipulation of the thermal environment can help researchers determine the contribution of this factor to phenotypic variation in life-history traits. During the reproductive season, we kept female northern grass lizards, Takydromus septentrionalis (Lacertidae), in three temperature-controlled rooms (25, 28 and 32degreesC) to measure the effect of the maternal thermal environment on reproductive traits. Maternal thermal environment remarkably affected reproductive frequency and thereby seasonal reproductive output, but had little effect on reproductive traits per clutch or hatchling traits. Females kept at 32degreesC produced more clutches and thus had shorter clutch intervals than females from 28 to 25degreesC. Clutch size, clutch mass, relative clutch mass, egg size and hatchling traits did not vary among the three treatments. The eggs produced by the females were incubated at 27degreesC and the traits of hatchlings were measured. The result that egg (offspring) size was independent of maternal thermal environments is consistent with the prediction of the optimal egg size (offspring) theory. The eggs produced by low temperature females (28 and 25degreesC) took longer time to complete their post-oviposition development than did eggs produced by high temperature females (32degreesC). This suggests that the eggs from low temperatures might have been laid when the embryos were at relatively early stages. Therefore, maternal thermal environment prior to oviposition could affect post-oviposition development in T septentrionalis. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The locomotor capacity of hatchlings incubated at 33degreesC was completely destroyed, whereas that of hatchlings from the other three temperatures did not differ significantly in spite of the existence of differences in hatchling size. Moreover, incubation temperature affected the allocation of energy between carcass and yolk sac in the hatchling, although the overall conversion of energy from eggs to hatchlings was not influenced by temperature.

We tested this hypothesis with a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi), using thermal-imaging methods to quantify temperatures (of both head and body) selected by hatchling lizards. The Young lizards kept their heads cooler than their bodies, but mean selected temperatures did not differ among hatchlings from three populations with differing thermal regimes in natural nests, nor were they affected by thermal conditions during incubation.

Both diel thermal fluctuations and mean temperature significantly affected incubation duration, but not hatching success. Incubation duration increased with increasing temperature fluctuations at a mean temperature of 24 degrees C, but not at a mean temperature of 28 degrees C. The significant interaction between diel thermal fluctuations and mean temperature on hatchling morphology indicated that the effect of thermal fluctuations depended on the mean temperature.

The mean values for female size and egg size were both greater in the two northern populations (Chuzhou and Anji) than in the three southern populations (Lishui, Dongtou, and Ningde). The larger eggs were entirely attributable to the body size of females in the Anji population, but their increased size also stemmed from further enlargement of egg size relative to female body size in Chuzhou, the northernmost population sampled in this study. Eggs of the Chuzhou population contained more yolk and less water than those of southern populations. Despite the lower lipid content in the yolk, eggs from the Chuzhou population had higher energy contents than those from the two southern populations, owing to the larger egg size and increased volume of yolk. Hatchling size was not affected by incubation temperature, but differed significantly among populations, with hatchlings being larger in the Chuzhou population than in the other populations.

Selection on incubation duration could change either of those traits. We examined embryonic development of fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) from three populations (Indiana, Mississippi, and Florida) that occur at different latitudes and therefore experience different temperatures and season lengths. These data reveal countergradient variation: at identical temperatures in the laboratory, incubation periods were shorter for lizards from cooler areas. This variation was not related to stage at oviposition; eggs of all populations were laid at similar developmental stages. Instead, embryonic development proceeded more rapidly in cooler-climate populations, compensating for the delayed development caused by lower incubation temperatures in the field.

Seven constant temperature treatments (spanning 20-36 degreesC) were employed and a split clutch design was used to assign eggs from the same clutch to the different treatments. Incubation time varied significantly with temperature treatments. Embryos incubated at 32 degreesC, 34 degreesC and 36 degreesC hatched between 41 and 46 days, whereas embryos incubated at 26 degreesC and 28 degreesC hatched at 83 and 67 days respectively. Hatching success was higher at 28 degreesC, 30 degreesC, 32 degreesC and 34 degreesC, but much lower at 26 degreesC and 36 degreesC; hatching did not occur at 20 degreesC. Eggs incubated at 26 degreesC and 36 degreesC produced only females. At 28 degreesC, 30 degreesC, 32 degreesC and 34 degreesC, the percentages of males were 9%, 53.5%, 32%, and 58% respectively. These sex ratios can be explained by a temperature-dependent mechanism of sex determination. The relative growth rates are highest early in incubation and lower for several days prior to hatching. The relationship between snout-to-vent length and age of embryos seems to be best described by a polynomial fitted regression. Growth rates at 26 degreesC were much lower than those at 34 degreesC. Constant incubation temperatures affected both snout-to-vent length and body mass at hatching, with maximum body size occurring at intermediate constant incubation temperatures (30 degreesC, 32 degreesC and 28 degreesC). According to this study, the optimal temperatures of embryonic development probably lies within the range 28-34 degreesC.

In TSD reptiles, yolk steroids not only may influence sex determination, but also may mediate hormonal effects on subsequent growth and behavior, as in some avian species, We investigated changes in the levels of estradiol (E-2) and testosterone (T) during development in yolks of snapping turtle eggs, examined how incubation temperature affects hormone levels, and determined how hormones in turtle eggs are influenced by individual females ( = clutch effects). Results indicate significant decreases in both hormones (> 50% decline) by the end of the sex-determining period. when two-thirds of the development is complete. The declines in both E-2 and T were significantly affected by incubation temperature. but in different ways. Eggs incubated at female-producing temperatures maintained high levels, those incubated at male-producing temperatures had low E-2 values, and eggs incubated at pivotal temperatures had intermediate levels of E-2. At all three temperatures, T values underwent significant but approximately equal declines, except during the developmental stages just after the sex-determining period, when T levels decreased more at the male-producing temperature than at either of the other two temperatures. Initially, there were significant clutch effects in both hormones, but such differences, attributable to individual females. were maintained only for E-2 later in development. Here we report for the first time that incubation temperature significantly affects the hormonal environment of the developing embryo of a turtle with temperature-dependent sex determination. Based on this and related findings, we propose that yolk sex steroids influence sexual differentiation in these TSD species and play a role in sex determination at pivotal temperatures.

Crucial issues include: (i) the magnitude of effects elicited by thermal regimes in natural nests (as opposed to constant-temperature incubation) (ii) the persistence of these effects during ontogeny; and (iii) the consistency of these effects across different test conditions (does the thermal regime during embryogenesis simply shift the hatchling's thermal optimum for performance, or actually modify overall performance ability regardless of temperature?). We examined these questions by incubating eggs of scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) from montane southeastern Australia, under two fluctuating-temperature regimes that simulated 'cold' and 'hot' natural nests. These thermal regimes substantially modified hatchling morphology (mass, body length, tail length, and the relationship between these variables), locomotor performance (running speeds over distances of 25 cm and 1 m), antipredator 'tactics' and survival rates. The differences in locomotor performance persisted throughout the 20 weeks of our experiment. Lizards that emerged after 'hot' incubation were faster runners than their 'cold'-incubated siblings under all thermal conditions that we tested. Thus, incubation temperatures modified overall locomotor ability, with only a minor effect on the set-point for optimum performance. The magnitude, persistence and consistency of these incubation-induced phenotypic modifications suggest that they may play an important role in evolutionary and ecological processes within lizard populations.

Reduced levels of oxygen during embryogenesis did not affect pigmentation, although such levels had produced small significant changes in developmental time. Elevated levels of carbon dioxide during development had a greater influence on pigmentation than did incubation temperature without producing as great a lengthening of incubation time. Hence, the changes in pigmentation produced by temperature and carbon dioxide could not be simply a function of their effects on developmental time. The carbon dioxide and temperature produced parallel changes in plastral pattern. In contrast, carbon dioxide had marked effects on skin pigmentation that were not paralleled by those of temperature. In addition, there were some significant differences among clutches in the effects of incubation temperature and carbon dioxide on pigmentation.

Another common pattern has low as well as high temperatures yielding only or mostly females and some intermediate temperatures yielding mostly males. Patterns tend to be associated with the direction of sexual dimorphism in adult size, especially for species with strong dimorphism. Pivotal temperatures (those yielding 1:1 sex ratios) within the best-documented species and genera tend to increase with both latitude and longitude across central and southern North America. These geographic trends probably reflect factors that affect nest temperatures (duration of growing season, insolation, and prevailing amounts of shading by vegetation). Data from a population of the alligator snapping turtle (Macroclemys temminckii) suggest that some embryos are temperature-independent females because these individuals become females even when they are shifted among male-producing temperatures during development. These individuals are also more frequent in clutches of small eggs. In this and several other species, no constant incubation temperatures yield more than 75% males.

The sample from the highest latitude yielded male-biased sex ratios across the broadest range of cool temperatures. This male-biased zone and those of die other five samples collectively contributed to a nested arrangement that is approximately symmetrical around a temperature of 24.5degreesC. Two indices of ternperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) patterns (MF pivotal temperature. width of the male-biased zone) were significantly associated with latitude and with published data on several climatic variables (e.g. sunshine and rainfall). At high latitudes, females nest in exposed locations, locally the warmest places. At low latitudes females place their nests in shaded locations. Such nest site selection renders, high latitude nests warmer than low latitude nests, even if only intermittently Given that constant conditions show, faster ernbryogenesis in high vs low latitude eggs, exposed nest sites seem to be an additional adaptation to hasten embryogenesis in high latitude nests. At low latitudes, shading prevents nests front overheating.

Nests of Podocnemis expansa placed in coarse sediments have shorter incubation duration than those placed in finer sediments. The hatching success in P. expansa is influenced by grain size, incubation duration, and nesting period. The grain size is negatively correlated with hatching success, indicating that the nests situated in finer-grained sand have better chances of successful egg hatching than those in coarser-grained sand. Nests of the end of the reproductive season have lower hatching success and incubation duration than those at the start of the season. For P. unifilis, the nesting period and nest depth influence the incubation duration; moreover, the river dynamics significantly affect the hatching success.

We incubated eggs from this species in four laboratory treatments, mimicking cool and moist, cool and dry, warm and moist, and warm and dry natural nest-sites, and assessed several morphological and behavioural traits of lizards after hatching. Incubation temperature influenced a lizard's hatching success, incubation period, tail length and antipredator behaviour, whereas variation in hydric conditions did not engender significant phenotypic variation for most traits. However, moisture affected incubation period slightly differently in males and females, and for a given snout-vent length moisture interacted weakly with temperature to affect lizard body mass. Although incubation conditions can substantially affect phenotypic variation among hatchling lizards, the absence of strong hydric effects suggests that hatchling lizards react less plastically to variation in moisture levels than they do to thermal conditions.

Exogenous estrogen causes the formation of ovaries, and prevention of estrogen biosynthesis results in the development of testes. In mammals, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-l) regulates most genes required for estrogen biosynthesis from cholesterol. In mammals as well as red-eared slider turtles, SF-l is differentially expressed in males and females during gonadogenesis.

Following ovariectomy, females from both all-female (26 degrees C) and male-biased (32.5 degrees C) incubation temperatures exhibited a significant decrease in high-posture (HP) aggression toward male and female stimulus animals. Testosterone treatment attenuated this decrease in HP aggression toward female but not toward male stimulus animals. Ovariectomy also resulted in a loss in attractiveness in both groups of females. Following treatment with testosterone, over 50% of the females were attacked by male stimulus animals, suggesting a change in the pheromonal cues normally secreted by females. Unmanipulated females never exhibit tail vibrations, a male-typical courtship behavior. However, following ovariectomy with testosterone treatment, half of the females from both incubation temperatures exhibited this behavior, indicating an activational effect of testosterone. An effect of incubation temperature on aggression was evident with females from the male-biased incubation temperature exhibiting a greater likelihood of aggression compared to females from the all-female incubation temperature. This effect continued to be detected after hormone manipulation. Ovariectomized females from the all-female incubation temperature were less aggressive even with testosterone treatment toward males, whereas females from the male-biased incubation temperature showed no significant decline in aggression following testosterone treatment, suggesting that individuals from different incubation temperatures may have different sensitivities to hormones.

Developmental arrest in response to egg inundation is unique to C. rugosa. Eggs can be stored under water for up to 10 weeks without appreciable impact on egg or embryo survival, allowing the transport and sale of eggs into niche markets without high levels of mortality, and permitting eggs to accumulate in diapause until there are sufficient numbers to incubate as batches. Eggs that are not inundated or inundated for short periods experience similar survival rates to eggs inundated for lengthy periods. Incubation temperature influences embryo survival and development period in C. rugosa. Embryonic survival is greatest at 26 degrees C, steadily declining as temperature increases to 32 degrees C. A similar increase in incubation temperature decreases incubation period by approximately 40 days, however almost half of this variation is attributed to the increase in incubation temperature from 26 to 28 degrees C. Hatchling growth in C. rugosa is characterized by two phases. There is an initial phase of relatively slow growth under the partial influence of initial egg size and incubation duration, followed by a second phase of relatively rapid growth under the partial influence of water temperature and mass at hatching. Post-hatching survival is negatively correlated with duration of egg inundation and water temperature. Evidence suggests that inundation of C rugosa eggs for 6 weeks, incubation of embryos at 28 degrees C and raising hatchlings in 28 degrees C water will yield the best overall outcomes.

Theoretical models predict that species with environmental sex determination will bias sex allocation in favour of the sex produced in the environment that yields lower fitness. These models have been proposed as an explanation for the biased sex ratios observed in many reptiles with environmental sex determination. We explore the effects of developmental environment on sex allocation in Graptemys ouachitensis, a turtle with environmental sex determination. We found that developmental environments producing males were poorest for survival, growth and performance, suggesting that the sex ratio of G ouachitensis should be male-biased. This expectation contrasts with the observed female bias in G. ouachitensis. Warmer than average temperatures may have contributed to the female-biased hatchling sex ratios reported for G ouachitensis in some studies. However, the strongly skewed population sex ratios in map turtles indicate female-biased allocation. The frequent finding of female-biased primary sex ratios in many species indicates an overall trend of female-biased sex allocation in reptiles with environmental sex determination. The conflict between this tendency for female biases and our results suggests that environmental effects on fitness will not explain the general tendency to skewed sex ratios.

Given the seriousness of the threat from climate change it is critical to understand the rate at which soil temperatures at sea turtles' nesting grounds are likely to change. This has stimulated the development of correlative models to assess and project how projected increases in temperature may impact sea turtle's reproductive output. Correlative models correlate climatic variables to soil temperature and hatchling sex ratio. These models have been widely used due to their simplicity and the flexibility of their data requirement. However, outputs are restricted by the environmental conditions used for the model and thus does not allow exploration of daily variation in sand temperature. Further, the potential error inherent in this approach has not been determined. Researchers working with other animals with temperature-dependent sex determination (TDS) have developed microclimate models to determine nest temperature and potential impacts from climate change. Microclimate models use the interaction between climate, soil, and topography with physiology and nesting behavior of animals to determine future production of hatchling sex ratios. Until now, microclimate models have never been applied to sea turtles and its correlation and consistency with correlative models has never been explored. To address this, we used the Niche Mapper (TM) microclimate model to project soil temperature at key sea turtle nesting grounds under various scenarios of global warming. Results from the microclimate model are compared to published projections from correlative models. The two approaches accurately and congruently model current soil temperature and project a feminization of the northern Great Barrier Reef green turtle population as climate change progresses. To provide guidance of when to use each approach we also reviewed the applicability and effectiveness of each model. The microclimate model provided a more robust picture of the incubating environment as it has the potential for projecting soil temperature for every hour of the day at various locations and depths within a nesting ground. This allows exploration of whether animals with TDS can counteract the impacts of global warming by changing nest depth and nesting distribution. With time and the validation of the microclimate model with short-term projections, the microclimate model can also be used to refine short-term adaptive management strategies as they can provide explicit recommendations on site-specific scales for translocation of eggs and alteration of the nesting environment.

However the embryos reared at high temperature (33-35 degrees C) have a shorter duration of incubation as well as gonadal differentiation. In contrast, exogenous application of the male hormone testosterone to embryos at ambient temperature (28 degrees C) results in almost all individuals with only testis. Thus the testosterone treatment reverts genic females to males and accelerates the differentiation of testis, a feature similar to the high-temperature treatment. Treatment of eggs with estradiol shows no difference from that seen in the untreated eggs. The present series of experiments was done to establish the ""window"" of testosterone sensitivity and to understand the interaction between sex hormones and high temperature on gonadal differentiation. The period between day 5 and 15 of embryonic development was the window period of testosterone sensitivity for sex reversal. This period coincided with the formation of the genital ridge and its differentiation into cortex and medulla. Treatment of the 33 degrees C-reared embryos with testosterone resulted in hatchlings of both the sexes, in contrast to only males at the ambient temperature. In contrast, at the same temperature (33 degrees C), all the dihydrotestosterone (nonaromatisable testosterone)-treated embryos hatched into males. However, those given estradiol showed no sex bias regardless of the day of application and the concentration of drug. Eggs were also treated with aromatase inhibitor, CGS 16949 A, at ambient temperature and at 33 degrees C. All the 33 degrees C eggs to which the drug was given on day 25 hatched into males. These results suggest that though high temperature has no direct effect on sex determination in this species, it may have a stimulatory effect an aromatase activity, leading to the conversion of the exogenously applied testosterone into estradiol and permitting ovarian differentiation in the genic females.

Exogenous administration of testosterone (100 mu g/egg) to embryos of stages 28, 30, and 33 results in the majority of them developing into males; no female is encountered. Testosterone also accelerates the differentiation of testes. Estradiol (5, 10, 15 mu g/egg), administered at the same stages as testosterone, does not show any effect on gonadal differentiation.

Females thermoregulated more precisely but did not shift their selected body temperatures during pregnancy, with females at high body temperatures giving birth early in the breeding season. The lowest (22 degrees C) and highest (32 degrees C) temperature treatments increased maternal mortality and resulted in production of offspring with smaller body dimensions. More deformed offspring were produced at 32 degrees C, and more poorly performing offspring were produced at 22 degrees C. In the field, air temperatures lower than 22 degrees C and higher than 32 degrees C accounted for about 9% and 33% of total temperature readings, respectively. However, offspring produced by field-caught females did not differ from those produced by laboratory-kept females with body temperatures optimal for embryonic development in nearly all traits examined.

We report the results of an experimental program at Playa Cuixmala, Jalisco, western Mexico. Sea turtle conservation efforts in Mexico have, in general, poor results because of lack of funds, which leads to insufficient beach protection and severe negative effects of nest removal on hatching success and sex ratios. Alternative strategies are needed to optimize limited resources. We predicted that intensive beach management, which included intense patrolling and careful nest reburial, could be an effective way to maximize nest survival and hatchling release under limited financial and human resources. The results of our 9-year study were very positive. Survival rate increased several fold during the study period. Hatching success and sex ratios were not significantly different between in-situ and removed nests. Survival in removed nests was, however, much higher that in-situ nests, because of predation and beach erosion. In total, the small (3 km length) Playa Cuixmala became the second most productive sea turtle nesting beach in the region because of these concentrated efforts. Intense beach management can be an important technique for sea turtle conservation, and can be properly applied to small beaches or the most productive sections of large beaches.

In this paper, we explore possible explanations for the diversity of sex determining modes in reptiles, and in particular, address the prevalence of reptilian temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) and its almost haphazard distribution across the reptile phylogeny. We suggest that reptiles are predisposed to evolving TSD from genotypic sex determination (GSD) by virtue of the uniquely variable thermal environment experienced by their embryos during the critical period in which sex is determined. Explicit mechanisms for canalization of sexual phenotype in the face of high thermal variation during development provide a context for thermolability in sex determination at extremes and the raw material for natural selection to move this thermolability into the developmental mainstream when there is a selective advantage to do so. Release of cryptic variation when canalization is challenged and fails at extremes may accelerate evolutionary transitions between GSD and TSD. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

To account for this, a mathematical model has been developed on the assumption that hatchling sex depends on the daily proportion of embryonic development that occurs above the threshold temperature for sex determination rather than the proportion of time spent above the threshold. The model predictions are borne out by experiments using the marine turtle Caretta caretta. Average developmental rates, both overall and during the period that sexual differentiation is sensitive to temperature, are unaffected by diel fluctuations about the mean incubation temperature. Sex ratios, on the other hand, were affected by diel fluctuations and ranged from ca. 100% males under regimes 26 +/- 0 degrees C and 26 +/- 3 degrees C to 100% females for regimes 26 +/- 7 degrees C and 26 +/- 8 degrees C. These and intermediate sex ratios were in close agreement with model predictions. Demonstration of an impact of temperature on sex, while holding overall developmental rate constant, gives support to hypotheses invoking a direct role for temperature rather than alternative hypotheses invoking overall developmental rate as a more proximal influence on sex. The model explains why mean temperature is a poor predictor of hatchling sex ratios. It; urges caution in using ''hours above the threshold'' for predicting sex ratios, because 1 hr at 1 degrees C above the threshold will not be equivalent to 1 hr at 4 degrees C above the threshold. It provides a general framework for integrating experiments at constant temperatures with those in the field or laboratory using fluctuating regimes. It provides greater scope for exploring how reptiles with temperature dependent sex determination might respond to climatic change or other disturbances to the incubation environment. And it provides an explanation of why secondary factors such a hydric conditions and oxygen potentials might influence hatchling sex, even if temperature acts directly to influence sex ratios rather than through its influence on overall developmental rate.

With the intention to preserve endangered and threatened species, two management tools have been suggested: artificial incubation at either male- or female-producing temperatures and introduction of many more females than males into populations by manipulating incubation temperatures to favor the production of female embryos. The use of estrogens during incubation has also been proposed to induce the development of females. We argue that in nature the incubation of eggs around the pivotal temperature is probably more frequent than generally recognized and leads to either phenotype adult females of phenotypic adult males, even though the embryonic testis may present various degrees of intersexuality, including ovotestes as documented in artificial incubation. Observations of the turtle Emys orbicularis show that, after hatching, ovotestes tend to evolve into testes by regression, total or partial of the ovarian-like cortex Testes with some immature oocytes at their surface have been observed in adult turtles and they produce spermatozoa. Therefore, gonadal intersexuality apparently does not hinder the reproductive male function in adults. We draw attention to the danger of estrogenic treatment of embryos to produce females. In many cases, such treatment induces thin gonads (""hypogonads"") in which the volume of both cortex and medulla are reduced. Exogenous estrogens may also result in the arrest of lengthening of the Mullerian ducts and sometimes in the opening of their caudal end in the Wolffian ducts. Either process results in the inability of adult females to evacuate eggs from oviducts. We modeled the long-term effects of introducing in a population a strongly female-biased primary sex ratio (20 females to 1 male) for 30 years. Taking into account a genetic component of sex determination as exemplified by the results of incubation at pivotal temperature, such a manipulation favors masculinizing alleles. When the manipulation is stopped, the primary sex ratio, as well as the adult sex ratio, becomes male-biased-a result contrary to that expected-and the population size decreases We recommend actions that protect adult populations and nesting sites and that improve the natural conditions of incubation in these sites rather than attempts to manipulate sex ratios.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,NA1180,Girondot,M.

We have checked this model to evaluate the evolution of populations invaded by new alleles changing the sensitivity of embryos to incubation temperature or the nesting behaviour of females. In both cases, the population is invaded by masculinizing alleles and becomes extinct because the number of females becomes insufficient to maintain a large enough effectif of reproductive females.

Most turtle species exhibit a form of ESD known as temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), and in such species the chronology of sex differentiation is well studied. Apalone spinifera is a species of softshell turtle (Trionychidae) that exhibits GSD. We studied sexual differentiation in this species in order to facilitate comparison to TSD species. Eggs were incubated at two different temperatures and embryos were harvested at various stages of mid to late development. Gonad length was measured with image analysis software, then prepared histologically. Indifferent gonads have differentiated in stage 19 embryos. Histological details of gonadogenesis follow the same pattern as described for other reptiles. Regression of the male paramesonephric duct closely follows testicular differentiation. Gonad lengths are longer at the warmer incubation temperature, and ovaries are generally longer than testes at each stage and for each temperature. Although sexual differentiation takes place at about the same stage as in other turtles with TSD (18-20), in A. spinifera this differentiation is irreversible at this stage, while in some of the TSD species sex is reversible until about stage 22. This immutable, definitive sexual differentiation may support the hypothesis of an accelerated chronology of sex differentiation for this species. We also note that sexual dichromatism at hatching is known in this species and may provide additional evidence of early differentiation. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss,Inc.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1191,Guo,"J.-H.

Hatchling sex is determined by nest temperatures that are due to the combination of daily and seasonal weather conditions, together with maternal nest site selection. Over the prolonged egg-laying season, mean nest temperatures steadily increase. This suggests that hatchling sex is best predicted by the date of egg laying, and that sex ratios from field nests will vary over the course of the breeding season. Lizards hatching from eggs laid in the spring (October) experience a longer growing season and should reach a larger body size by the beginning of their first reproductive season, compared to lizards from eggs laid in late summer (February). Adult male A. muricatus attain a greater maximum body size and have relatively larger heads than females, possibly as a consequence of sexual selection due to male-male competition for territories and mates. If reproductive success in males increases with larger body size, then early hatching males may obtain a greater fitness benefit as adults, compared to males that hatch in late summer.

The present study was designed in order to compare the rates of embryonic development and birth dates in the oviparous and viviparous strains under laboratory conditions and in semi-natural outdoor enclosures. In the oviparous strain a strong negative correlation exists between incubation temperature and incubation duration. The difference in birth dates between oviparous and viviparous forms does not exceed one week when oviparous eggs are artificially incubated under temperatures close to the body temperatures of pregnant viviparous females. On the other hand, oviparous eggs incubated under lower temperatures in the outdoor enclosure hatched approximately one month after parturition of the viviparous females. These results support the idea that a main advantage of viviparity is that the embryos can develop more rapidly at high maternal temperatures than at low soil temperatures.

Information on the natural nest environment of flatback turtles (Natator depressus) is lacking. Therefore, the current study investigated the thermal and hydric environment of their nest chambers and nesting beach (at Peak Island, cast coastal Queensland during the 1996, 1997 and 1997/1998 nesting seasons). The temperature of nest chambers and the nesting beach showed temporal and spatial variation. Beach temperature increased through the nesting season as summer progressed and showed significant vertical and lateral variation. The temperature in the core of nest chambers increased as incubation progressed (on average 7 C) apparently because of both metabolic heating and the natural seasonal increase in sand temperature. The temperature range of nests was 25.5-36.5 C, with many nests exposed to temperatures above 35 C for extended periods. Water content of sand surrounding nest chambers at the beginning of incubation ranged from 2.6-7.8%, (w/w), varying with date of laying and location on the beach. Natator depressus eggs may be more tolerant of high incubation temperatures and severe moisture stress than those of most other sea turtle species. Nest success was not influenced by the position of the nest on the beach but was positively related to clutch size. Neither nest success nor clutch size varied significantly between subsequent clutches of an individual female. Hatchling sex ratio at this beach possibly depends on the date of egg laying. Because high density nesting occurs when beach temperature appears to produce almost all female hatchlings, the hatchling sex ratio at Peal, Island is likely to be biased toward females.

Adult males possess bilateral penises called hemipenes, which are independently controlled by two muscles, the retractor penis magnus (RPM) and transversus penis (TPN). These structures are Dot obvious in adult females. However, in adult female leopard geckos (Eublepharis macularius), testosterone induces hemipene growth. We investigated whether these structures develop de novo in adulthood or are histologically present as rudimentary structures in the female leopard gecko. We also investigated the extent of sexual dimorphisms and plasticity in the associated neuromuscular components. To do this, we compared copulatory morphology (sizes of hemipenes, RPM and TPN muscle fibers, and associated motoneurons, as well as motoneuron and RPM fiber number) in adult females treated with testosterone, control females, and control males. All of the geckos possessed hernipenes, RPMs and TPNs, but these structures were indeed vestigial in control females. Testosterone induced striking increases in hemipene and copulatory muscle fiber size in females, but not to levels equivalent to control males. In parallel, males with increased levels of androgenic activity had larger hernipenes, suggesting naturally occurring steroid-induced plasticity. Copulatory motoneurons were not sexually dimorphic in size or number, and these measures did not respond to testosterone. The data demonstrate that the copulatory system of leopard geckos, in which gonadal sex is determined by egg incubation temperature, differs from that of many species (both reptilian and mammalian) with genotypic sex determination. Indeed, the system is remarkable in that adult females have normally occurring intersex characteristics and they exhibit substantial steroid-induced morphological plasticity in adulthood.

However, for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) nesting on the Creek Island of Kefalonia, a more asynchronous pattern of emergence has been documented. By placing temperature loggers at the top and bottom of nests laid on Kefalonia during 1998, we examined whether this asynchronous emergence was related to the thermal conditions within nests. Pronounced thermal variation existed not only between, but also within, individual nests. These within-nest temperature differences were related to the patterns of hatchling emergence, with hatchlings from nests displaying large thermal ranges emerging over a longer time-scale than those characterised by more uniform temperatures. In many egg-laying animals, parental care of the offspring may continue while the eggs are incubating and also after they have hatched. Consequently, the importance of the nest site for determining incubation conditions may be reduced since the parents themselves may alter the local environment. By contrast, in marine turtles, parental care ceases once the eggs have been laid and the nest site covered. The positioning of the nest site, in both space and time, may therefore have profound effects for marine turtles by affecting, for example, the survival of the eggs and hatchlings as well as their sex (Janzen and Paukstis 1991).",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,NA1207,Huang,V.

Interpreting this result in light of studies of sex steroid hormone involvement in sex determination, they suggested that maternally derived yolk steroid hormones could constrain sex-determining mechanisms in TSD reptiles. We have worked extensively with this species and have routinely incubated clutches at constant temperatures. To test the consistency of high frequency same-sex clutches across different incubation temperatures, we examined our records of clutches at the University of Texas at Austin from 1992 to 2001. We observed that clutches in which eggs were incubated at the same incubation temperature produced mixed-sex clutches as well as same-sex clutches.

Through nest-site selection, mothers exert control over the incubation environment to which eggs are exposed, which in turn can affect offspring fitness. The strong relationship between offspring quality and incubation temperature in many ectotherms suggests that contemporary climate change could modify the fitness benefits gained from such behaviour. 2. We used life-history data from a tropical lizard (the long-tailed skink, Eutropis longicaudata) to show that a natural dichotomy in nesting habitat directly influences fitness, but that higher ambient temperatures in recent years are having a disproportionate impact on 'optimal' nest sites. 3. Gravid lizards either lay eggs beneath rocks in natural habitat or inside a concrete wall in human-modified habitat, where incubation temperatures are higher. Consequently, females using artificial habitat produced larger hatchlings that matured earlier and had higher rates of survival than conspecifics using natural habitat. 4. Ambient temperatures have impacted artificial habitats disproportionately over the last decade by increasing nest temperatures in artificial habitat three times that of natural habitat (1.5 vs. 0.5 degrees C, respectively). This has reversed nest-site quality by lowering offspring viability of artificial nest sites, but has increased offspring viability of natural nest sites. 5. Climate change has overridden the fitness benefits derived from nesting in artificial habitats, but has caused a resultant increase in the fitness benefits derived from nesting in natural habitats. Laboratory incubation experiments confirm that these patterns are attributed to temperature. 6. Our study highlights the interactive effects of disparate human environmental impacts on fauna; by creating the concrete wall, human habitat modification initially conferred fitness benefits by increasing incubation temperatures, but human-induced climate change has raised nest temperatures above the point at which fitness is reduced. 7. Contemporary climate change is altering the location and availability of 'optimal' nesting habitat, thereby changing the ability of nesting females to adaptively manipulate the phenotypes of their offspring. Consequently, human-induced climate change can lead to some habitats becoming ecological traps.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,NA1210,Huf,"Huf, P. A. ; A. R. Bourne and T. G.

Soil temperature was the most important factor in nest-site selection. Temperatures and total thermal units were significantly higher and more variable in real nests than in false nests, except during the night. Soil composition was not significantly different among treatments. Grain sizes ranged from fine to gravel, and real nests contained mainly (58% to 96%) medium sand or larger grains.

Earlier studies on this species presented little evidence to the sex-determining mechanism. Here we provide evidences for the potential role played by incubation temperature that has a significant effect (P<0.01) on gonadal sex and sex ratio. The eggs were incubated at 14 different incubation temperatures. Interestingly, 100% males were produced at low (25.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C) as well as high (34 +/- 0.5 degrees C) incubation temperatures and 100% females were produced at low (23.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C) and high (31.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C) temperatures, clearly indicating the occurrence of TSD in this species. Sex ratios of individual clutches did not vary at any of the critical male-producing or female-producing temperatures within as well as across the seasons. However, clutch sex ratios were female- or male-biased at intermediate temperatures. Thermosensitive period occurred during the embryonic stages 3033. Three pivotal temperatures operate producing 1:1 sex ratio. Histology of gonad and accessory reproductive structures provide additional evidence for TSD. The sex-determining pattern, observed for the first time in this species, that neither compares to Pattern I [Ia (MF) and Ib (FM)] nor to Pattern II (FMF), is being referred to as FMFM pattern of TSD.

In reptiles, growth is subject to proximate environmental influences, such as food availability and temperature, that may be crucial during the early stages of postnatal development. Mediterranean regions, with their severe summer drought, offer an excellent opportunity to examine the effects of environmental variations in precipitation and productivity on the timing of reproduction and growth rates of lizards. 2. In this study, we compared the incubation time, size at hatching, growth rates and changes in juvenile body condition of two nearby populations of the lizard Psammodromus algirus separated by 600-700 m altitude in central Spain. We combined a reciprocal incubation experiment at 27 and 30 degrees C with a reciprocal transplant experiment to distinguish between environmental and population-specific sources of geographical variation. 3. At both temperatures, eggs from the high-elevation site hatched sooner. Several important phenotypic traits of juveniles were primarily determined by the growing environment: the high-elevation site provided more food and allowed hatchlings to grow faster and reach larger size. 4. Environmental effects overrode familial ones, as shown by the larger growth rate of half-sibs released at the high-elevation site. However, both the size and the growth rate of juveniles were also influenced by their mother's site of origin, which means that population differences may reflect a genetic differentiation and/or different maternal effects. 5.

Temperatures at oviposition sites (mean +/- SD = 26.0 +/- 1 1.9 degrees C) were on average lower and had a lower variance than those at available sites (32.0 +/- 6.2 degrees C). The duration of incubation decreased dramatically as temperature increased. In fact, the hatching dates predicted by the temperatures selected in the thermogradients were delayed with respect to the mean emergence dates observed in the field. Such disparity might occur because (1) natural incubation temperatures are variable rather than constant, (2) they are expected to rise later in the season, and (3) temperatures that are too high can severely compromise embryonic survival.

However, hatchlings from warmer nests had smaller carapace dimensions than hatchlings from cool nests suggesting that more yolk was converted to hatchling tissue during embryonic development in cool nests. There was considerable intra- and inter-nest variation in both crawling and swimming performance of hatchlings. Hatchlings from cool nests tended to be faster crawlers than hatchlings from warm nests, but the thrust produced during swimming was not correlated with nest temperature.

In the present study, we examined the effects of basking and food availability (2 by 2 factorial design) during gestation on offspring phenotype in a matrotrophic viviparous lizard (Pseudemoia entrecasteauxii). Subsequently, we investigated if the maternal effects were context-dependent using offspring growth rate as an indicator of the adaptive significance of matrotrophy. Offspring were exposed either to the same thermal conditions as their mothers experienced or to thermal conditions different from those experienced by their mothers. We provide the first evidence that an interaction between maternal thermal and maternal food conditions during gestation strongly affects offspring phenotype, including date of birth, body size and performance ability, which affect offspring fitness. Offspring growth rate was dependent on offspring thermal conditions, but was not influenced by maternal effects or offspring sex. Matrotrophic viviparity provided gravid females with the means to enhance offspring fitness through greater energetic input to offspring when conditions allowed it (i.e., extended basking opportunity with high food availability).

Mating occured in mid-May, and females migrated 30-173 m to potential nest sites in mid to late June. Females often abandoned initial attempts at digging nest burrows, and average time from initiation of the final burrow to completion of a covered nest was six days. At least some females completely buried themselves within the burrow during the final stages of burrow construction and oviposition. Females defended the burrow site during the entire time of construction, and most continued that defense for at least three to four weeks after nest completion. Nests were completed between mid-June and mid-July, but for unknown reasons timing was seven days earlier on U Cay than on Leaf Cay. Nest burrows averaged 149 cur in length and terminal nest chambers usually angled off the main burrow. Depth to the bottom of the egg chamber averaged 28 cm, and was inversely correlated with shadiness of the site, suggesting that females may select depths with preferred temperatures (mean, 31.4 C in this study). Overall, only about one in three females nested each year, although nesting frequency increased with female size such that the largest females usually nest annually. Nest fidelity was common, despite the potential for observer effects; seven of 13 two-year nesters placed nests within 0.7 m of that constructed the previous year. Nesting females averaged 32 cm snout-vent length (SVL) and 1.336 g body mass, and larger, older females nested earlier than smaller, younger ones. Sexual maturity is reached at 26-27 cm SVL, about 750 g body mass, and twelve years of age (nearly twice as old as any previously studied lizard). Longevity of females apparently exceeds 40 years. Clutch size ranged from 1-10 eggs (mean 4.6) and was correlated with female body size and age. Eggs averaged 66 mm in length, 35 mm in width, and 49 g in mass, Egg mass was not correlated with female body size, although egg length was negatively correlated, and egg width was positively correlated with female size. The production of elongate eggs in the smaller females allowed them to invest the same total mass in each egg as a larger female, while being constrained by the limits of the pelvic opening. No trade-off existed between standardized clutch size versus egg size. Relative clutch mass (clutch mass/gravid female body mass X 100) averaged 16.5 and did not vary with female size or age. Hatching apparently occurs in late September and early October after about 80-85 days incubation, with emergence within just a few days. Hatchlings averaged 9.5 cm SVL and 33 g body mass.

Comparisons of these data with those available for other rock iguanas of the genus Cyclura suggest that colonization of smaller islands has produced reductions in adult female body size, clutch size, clutch mass, and relative clutch mass, but no change in egg or hatchling mass. Because this pattern is also demonstrated by a population of Cuban iguanas introduced to a small island only 40 years ago, it may primarily be a proximal response to decreased resource availability and/or physiological processability on small islands rather than an evolved response to reduced predation rates or other factors affecting survivorship.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,Not applicable; natural nest data1220,Jain,"Jain, MK; M.

The bound enzyme coelutes with the vesicles during gel filtration through a nonequilibrated Sephadex G-100 column, modifies the phase transition behavior of bilayers, and exhibits an increase in fluorescence intensity accompanied by a blue shift. Using these criteria it is demonstrated that the snake-venom enzyme binds to bilayers of the diether-PC14alone. In contrast, the porcine enzyme binds only to ternary codispersions of dialkyl (or diacyl) phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine and fatty acid. Binding of the pig-pancreatic enzyme to vesicles of the diether-PC14æcould not be detected even after long incubation (up to 24 h) below, at, or above the phase-transition temperature, whereas the binding in the presence of products is almost instantaneous and observed over a wide temperature range. Thus incorporation of the products in substrate dispersions increases the binding affinity rather than increase the rate of binding. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the pancreatic enzyme binds to defect sites at the phase boundaries in substrate bilayers induced by the products.

Eggs were incubated at three temperatures that produced mixed sex ratios. This experimental design provided estimates of the heritability of sex ratio in multiple environments and a test of the hypothesis that genotype X environment (G X E) interactions may be maintaining genetic variation for sex ratio in this population of C. serpentina. Substantial quantitative genetic variation for primary sex ratio was detected in all experimental treatments. These results in conjunction with the occurrence of TSD in this species provide support for three critical assumptions of Fisher's theory for the microevolution of sex ratio. There were statistically significant effects of family and incubation temperature on sex ratio, but no significant interaction was observed. Estimates of the genetic correlations of sex ratio across environments were highly positive and essentially indistinguishable from + 1. These latter two findings suggest that G X E interaction is not the mechanism maintaining genetic variation for sex ratio in this system. Finally, although substantial heritable variation exists for primary sex ratio of C. serpentina under constant temperatures, estimates of the effective heritability of primary sex ratio in nature are approximately an order of magnitude smaller. Small effective heritability and a long generation time in C. serpentina imply that evolution of sex ratios would be slow even in response to strong selection by, among other potential agents, any rapid and/or substantial shifts in local temperatures, including those produced by changes in the global climate.",N,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,Y,Exlcuded because heritability is not a phenotype1224,Janzen,F.

In particular, I tested the hypothesis that temperature has a direct effect on physiology of developing embryos independent of the hydric environment, specifically as expressed through its effects on hatchling size and locomotor performance. Hatching success was lowest at 26-degrees but did not differ significantly among treatments or between years. Survivorship of turtles to 2 wk posthatching varied significantly among temperature treatments, because relatively few individuals from 26-degrees-C survived. Duration of incubation was negatively related to incubation temperature. However, sex determination of hatchling turtles was independent of incubation temperature. All but one measure of body size of turtles varied positively with incubation temperature in both years, which suggests that temperature directly affected embryonic growth. Body size of hatchlings also differed significantly among clutches, even after accounting for initial egg mass, which implies maternal or genetic variation in embryonic development. Measures of locomotor performance (running and swimming speed) were significantly influenced by incubation temperature in both years, such that warmer temperatures produced faster hatchlings. In 1989, but not in 1990, larger turtles ran and swam faster than smaller individuals. Clutch exhibited a significant influence on running and swimming speed in both years, which suggests maternal or genetic effects underlying performance. Both measures of locomotor performance were positively correlated in both years, and the correlations were significant, which indicates that faster runners were also faster swimmers. Running and swimming speed were highly repeatable within the 1-d trials in both years and exhibited significant heritable variation. These findings highlight the pervasive influence of environmental and genetic factors on the physiological ecology of embryonic and hatchling turtles and indicate that growth and locomotor performance may possess the genetic variation necessary to evolve in response to selection pressures in nature.

Consistent with theoretical predictions, annual offspring sex ratio was highly correlated with mean July air temperature, validating concerns about the effect of climate change on population demography. This correlation implies that even modest increases in mean temperature (<2 degrees C) may drastically skew the sex ratio. Statistical evaluation of the variance in climate change indicates that an increase in mean temperature of 4 degrees C would effectively eliminate production of male offspring.

Hatchling sex ratio within nests was predictably related to the nesting beach and to the quantity of solar exposure at the nest mainly from the south. The North beach tended to produce more all-male nests and an overall male-biased sex ratio than did the South beach. Within each beach, nests with more vegetational cover on the southern and perhaps western aspects produced more males than did more exposed nests. However, the relationship between solar exposure and nest sex ratio was absent during two atypically cool summers.

Laboratory experiments indicated that two performance variables, but no morphological measurements, were significantly influenced by incubation temperature (P less than or equal to 0.05): hatchlings from cooler incubation treatments swam faster than turtles from warmer incubation treatments, and hatchlings from 28 degrees C exhibited a greater propensity to run than did individuals from 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C. In the field, hatchlings from the all-male and all-female producing temperatures had significantly higher first-year survivorship than did consexuals from the incubation temperature that produced both sexes (G = 6.622, P = 0.03). Significant directional selection was detected on propensity of hatchlings to run (beta' = -0.758, P = 0.05): turtles that tended to remain immobile had a higher probability of first-year survivorship than did individuals that moved readily. Thus, the effects of the gender x incubation temperature interaction on survivorship of hatchling turtles observed in the field experiment may have been mediated by temperature-dependent antipredator behavior.

All viable eggs increased in mass over the course of incubation due to absorption of water, and mass gain during incubation was dependent on initial egg mass, temperature and substrate water potential. Variations in the wet mass of hatchlings among treatments stemmed mainly from variations in water content. Hatching success, embryonic use of energy and nutrients, and sex, size and mass of hatchlings were unaffected over a wide range of substrate moisture. The incubation length decreased as temperature increased. However, the effect of substrate moisture on duration of incubation varied with temperature. The influence of incubation temperature on the snout-vent length of hatchlings, if present, was very weak. Incubation temperatures did not affect the sex ratio and carcass dry mass of hatchlings, but significantly affected the tail length of hatchlings, with individuals from the highest temperature having the shortest tails. The energy expenditure of embryogenesis during incubation remained remarkably constant among treatments, and energy reserves in the hatchling were largely dependent on allocation of energy materials in eggs.

There was obvious geographic variation in head shape of females, reproductive characteristics, timing date of oviposition, and thermal dependence of egg incubation between two populations. Skinks from Shaoguan began to lay eggs in mid-May, approximately two weeks earlier than the timing date of skinks from Lishui. Skinks from Shaoguan produced more but smaller eggs. The size-specific (SVL) clutch size of skinks from Shaoguan outnumbered that of skinks from Lishui by 2.8 eggs. It implied there was a trade-off between the number and the size of offspring between populations, because there was no difference in size-specific clutch mass among skinks from both populations, and skinks within a population could produce larger clutches without a concomitant reduction in egg mass. Overall, compared to eggs incubated under 32 degrees C, eggs incubated under 24 degrees C could produce larger (SVL) and well-developed hatchlings with less unutilized yolks. Compared to eggs from Lishui incubated under the same temperature of 24 degrees C and 32 degrees C, eggs from Shaoguan produced hatchlings with smaller body wet mass and carcass dry mass. Accordingly, there was geographic variation in suitable range of incubation temperatures, and eggs laid by skinks from Lishui could successfully incubate in a wider range of temperatures.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1238,Ji," Ji, X, B.

The phenomenon of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) was discovered almost thirty years ago, but few advances have been made towards the elucidation of its mechanism. In the past few years substantial progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular basis of XY chromosomal (genetic) sex determination (GSD) through the discovery of SRY. It is now possible to start comparing TSD with GSD. TSD is found in some evolutionarily ancient vertebrates and has been postulated to be the ancestral process from which GSD has evolved. If this is true then the two mechanisms may share a common molecular basis.

The pulmonary surfactant ( PS) system lowers the interfacial pressure within the lung, improving lung compliance and aiding lung clearance. In mammals, the AOE and PS systems develop in tandem during the final 10%-20% of gestation. Here, we investigated the development of these systems in the viviparous skink, Tiliqua rugosa. The content of total phospholipid (PL), disaturated phospholipid (DSP), and cholesterol ( Chol) increased in lung washings from foetal lizards with advancing gestational age. Similarly, the relative saturation of the PLs increased throughout gestation, with mid-stage 40 foetuses having a DSP/PL equivalent to newborns and adults. Maternal lizards had significantly less total PL, DSP, and Chol than nongravid and newborn lizards; however, the relative composition did not differ from nongravid animals. This presumably results from compression of the lungs under the bulk of the developing foetus. The Chol/PL and Chol/DSP ratios declined early in development such that mid-stage 40 embryos had comparable ratios to both newborns and adults. Thus, it appears that the PS system matures in a similar manner in skinks and in mammals. However, the composition of surfactant is complete some weeks before parturition, probably to enable improved survivorship of the precocial young in the event of premature birth. Unlike the surfactant lipids, the AOEs, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase did not differ appreciably throughout gestation. It appears therefore that like the surfactant lipids the AOE system is in readiness for air breathing throughout the latter stages of gestation, possibly in preparation for premature birth.

Eggs were half-buried in sand with 3 or 13% gravimetric water content and incubated at a constant 30 degrees C. Using a closed metabolic chamber, oxygen consumption, V-O2, was measured at decreasing oxygen tensions. Embryonic V-O2 varied as a function of incubation day and temperature, whereas the P-c differed among temperatures but not among incubation days. At a given incubation day, the P-c increased in direct proportion to temperature. Eggs incubated in sand with 13% gravimetric water content achieved greater mass at days 30 and 39 than did those in sand with 3% gravimetric water content. However, V-O2, P-c, and masses of yolk-free hatchlings were similar in the two hydric conditions, indicating that hypoxic tolerance of turtle eggs is not curtailed by excessive water absorption. The similarity in P-c is likely attributable to the small V-O2/surface area ratio of turtle eggs.

Hatchling sex ratios were estimated using incubation durations and sand temperatures for 20072009, while the empirical relationship between air and sand temperature was used to infer historical (18752010) and future (20112100) hatchling sex ratios. First, all six beaches produced males; 55% of production was across five beaches, while 45% was focused on one beach (primarily in July). Second, male production varied across the season in different years; there was an initial peak in June, with production (rising, declining or plateauing) later in the season being regulated by August air temperatures. Interestingly, the annual male production rate estimated from the 3-year dataset (23%) was half that estimated from the 135-year reconstruction (50%), with the latter showing broad interannual variation. Finally, modelled predictions of future sex ratios ranged from a conservative 7.6% decline in male production by 2100 versus no production by 2038.

For example, the phenotypic traits of a hatchling reptile can be influenced by the organism's genotype, by incubation temperature, and by genetically coded norms of reaction for thermally labile traits. The evolution of parthenogenesis provides a unique opportunity to explore such effects: a hybrid origin of this trait in vertebrates modifies important aspects of the genotype (e.g., heterozygosity, polyploidy) and may thus impact not only on the phenotype generally, but also on the ways in which incubation temperature affects expression of the phenotype. The scarcity of vertebrate parthenogenesis has been attributed to developmental disruptions, but previous work has rarely considered reaction norms of embryogenesis in this respect. We used closely related sexual and asexual races of the Australian gecko Heteronotia binoei, which include those with multiple origins of parthenogenesis, to explore the ways in which reproductive modes (sexual, asexual), incubation temperatures (24, 27, and 30degreesC), and the interaction between these factors affected hatchling phenotypes. The hatchling traits we considered included incubation period, incidence of deformities, hatchling survivorship, body size and shape, scalation (including fluctuating asymmetry), locomotor performance, and growth rate. Developmental success was slightly reduced (higher proportion of abnormal offspring) in parthenogenetic lineages although there was no major difference in hatching success. Incubation temperature affected a suite of traits including incubation period, tail length, body mass relative to egg mass, labial scale counts, running speed, growth rate, and hatchling survival. Our data also reveal an interaction between reproductive modes and thermal regimes, with the phenotypic traits of parthenogenetic lizards less sensitive to incubation temperature than was the case for their sexual relatives. Thus, the evolution of asexual reproduction in this species complex has modified both mean hatchling viability and the norms of reaction linking hatchling phenotypes to incubation temperature. Discussions on the reasons why parthenogenetic organisms are scarce in nature should take into account interactive effects such as these; future work could usefully try to tease apart the roles of parthenogenesis, its hybrid origin (and thus effects on ploidy and heterozygosity, etc.), and clonal selection in generating these divergent embryonic responses.",Y,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1248,Kearney,"Kearney, M",2012,"Metabolic Theory, Life History And The Distribution Of A Terrestrial Ectotherm",Functional Ecology,26,1,167-179,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01917.x,"1.

Nesting females selected mounds with >5 cm surrounding soil depth and initiated excavation and oviposition in early May. There was no correlation between female body size and termite mound size. Tunnels were excavated into lateral sides of mounds and terminated in nest chambers. Eggs were deposited outside the mound and pushed into the chamber using thrusts of the forelimbs.

However, the proposed mechanisms of steroid effects are thought to differ between TSD and GSD: a direct effect of oestrogens on gonad feminisation in TSD species vs a differential induction of male-producing or female-producing gametes in GSD species. Geckos offer an ideal opportunity for testing these suggested mechanisms. Closely related gecko species differ in their modes of sex determination. They lay clutches of two synchronously formed eggs; both eggs share equal steroid levels. If identical hormonal composition and environment during vitellogenesis, gravidity and incubation determine the sex of the progeny, siblings should share the same gender in both TSD and GSD geckos. We found strong support for this prediction in a TSD gecko species. Among clutches that were incubated at the temperature that produced both sexes, there were no clutches with siblings of the opposite sex. On the other hand, about half of the clutches yielded siblings of the opposite sex in four GSD species. These results suggest that sex-determining systems constrain the ability of the female to produce single-sex siblings and, hence, it seems that the GSD mechanism constrains the opportunities for sex ratio manipulation in geckos via yolk steroid manipulation.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1252,Labra,"Labra, A; Bozinovic, F",2002,Interplay Between Pregnancy And Physiological Thermoregulation In Liolaemus Lizards,Ecoscience,9,4,421-426,https://doi.org/10.1080/11956860.2002.11682729,"In squamate reptiles the effects of pregnancy on physiological thermoregulation, such as thermal tolerances and rates of heat exchange, are practically unknown.

Maternal metabolism was not influenced during early gestation by the number of embryos carried but was weakly influenced during late gestation. These results differ from previous investigations that show an increase in mass-independent oxygen consumption in reproductive females relative to nonreproductive females and a positive relationship between metabolism and litter size. These data also conflict with published field data on V. aspis that show a strong metabolic cost associated with reproduction. We propose that, under controlled conditions (i.e., females exposed to precise ambient temperatures), following the mobilisation of resources to create follicles (i.e., vitellogenesis), early gestation per se may not be an energetically expensive period in reproduction. However, under natural conditions, the metabolic rate of reproductive females is strongly increased by a shift in thermal ecology ( higher body temperature and longer basking periods), enabling pregnant females to accelerate the process of gestation. Combining both laboratory and field investigation in a viviparous snake, we suggest that reproduction entails discrete changes in the thermal ecology of females to provide optimal temperatures to the embryos, whatever their number.

A similar pattern characterizes Crocodylus palustris, C. moreletii, C. siamensis, and Gavialis gangeticus based on new data; published accounts establish a FMF pattern in Crocodylus porosus, C. johnstoni, and C. niloticus. TSD apparently occurs in Paleosuchus trigonatus and Alligator sinensis, but patterns are not yet documented. In the well-studied species, the incubation temperatures for FM transitions are congruent, but MF transition temperatures differ among species. In A. mississippiensis, 100% males are produced over a range of constant incubation temperatures, whereas in C. johnstoni, only low proportions of males are produced at any constant temperature. The thermosensitive period (TSP) for A. mississippiensis occurs during stages 21 to 24 (days 30-45 at intermediate temperatures) and coincides with gonadal differentiation. A similar scenario is suggested in other species. The TSP in A. mississippiensis (and possibly other crocodilians) encompasses the third quarter of development and occurs later than in turtles and a lizard. In A, mississippiensis as in turtles, the duration (cumulative effect) and/or the magnitude (potency effect) of incubation temperatures during the TSP predictably alter sex ratios. TSP chronologies and features which are shared among TSD reptiles suggest common, underlying mechanisms; A. mississippiensis is an appropriate model for further study. In crocodilians, clutch effects are a significant source of variation in TSD response. Hatchling sex ratios previously reported for A. mississippiensis are reconsidered in light of our new data.

Terrestrial ectotherms from temperate regions typically face thermal constraints and limited activity periods. Developmental conditions (i.e. embryonic life) and reproductive timing (laying date) should induce phenotypic variations and influence subsequent ontogenetic trajectories (growth and survival). We studied these combined influences in an oviparous squamate, the wall lizard (Podarcis muralis), comprising a multiple clutch species with natural variations in laying date for the first clutch. We experimentally manipulated maternal basking opportunities during gravidity (3, 6 or 9?h per day) and incubation temperature (23 or 29?degrees C). Early laying date positively influenced winter survival in both incubation treatments. Survival was significantly lower in cool than warm-incubated individuals (14.8% and 73.6%, respectively) because of delayed hatching date and reduced activity period before winter. Individuals from cool incubation temperature were slightly smaller but had a higher body condition and grew faster during the first month of life. Offspring behaviour was driven by complex interactions between gravidity and incubation treatments. Under cool incubation temperature, defensive behaviour was high, independently of gravidity treatment. Warm incubated individuals showed low defensive response except when maternal basking opportunities were restricted to 3?h. Defensive behaviour at birth had a positive influence on survival in cool-incubated individuals. The results of the present study highlight the long-term influence of hatching date that integrates female reproductive timing and incubation conditions.

At both sites, Corpus Christi Bay (CCB) and lower Laguna Madre (LLM), Texas, concurrent measurements of plant biomass and levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the water column and sediments were made over a 12-month period (October 1996-October 1997). Water-column NH4+ and NO3- + NO2- concentrations were not significantly different between study sites (ca. 1.2 mu M [NH4+] and 0.7 mu M [NO3- + NO2-] at both sites), but sediment NH4+ concentrations in CCB (87 mu M) were significantly higher than in LLM (26 mu M). The higher sediment NH4+ levels at CCB correlated with significantly higher leaf biomass at CCB, but there was no difference in root biomass between study sites. Leaf NH4+ uptake showed clear seasonal variation: V-max was highest in summer and fall, but K-m was highest in winter. V-max of leaf NO3- uptake did not change with season, but K-m decreased with increasing incubation temperature. There were no clear differences in leaf NH4+ and NO3- uptake rates between study sites, although leaf NH4+ uptake affinity was higher than that of NO3-. Root NH4+ uptake was variable with season and did not saturate at the experimental NH4+ concentrations at either site (0-300 mu M). Based on these measurements, N acquisition was highest during summer and fall and lowest curing winter and spring. Roots and leaves contributed nearly equally to total plant N acquisition (root NH4+ = 52%; leaf NH4+ = 38%; and leaf NO3- = 10%) at both sites. Annual N acquisition in CCB was double that of LLM (97.03 and 53.49 g N m(-2) yr(-1), respectively), but >50% of N uptake was not incorporated into biomass at either site. DIN turnover time ranged from 0.21 to 0.91 a in the water column and from 0.95 to 1.75 d in sediment pore water, indicating the importance of DIN regeneration processes for supporting seagrass production. The similarity in the relative tissue contributions between plants at both sites, despite a significant difference in sediment NH4+ pool sizes, results from the higher fraction of biomass allocated to belowground tissues in plants living under low-sediment N conditions (LLM). In N-sufficient sediments, overall plant productivity is greater as T. testudinum is able to allocate a greater proportion of its biomass into photosynthetic aboveground tissues.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Not applicable; Seegrass nitrogen budget1260,Lemieux,"Lemieux, A.

Few studies have examined how fluctuating temperatures, as would be experienced in natural nests, affect hatchling phenotype. Models predict that under fluctuating temperatures sex determination depends on the proportion of development that occurs above or below the pivotal temperature. We tested the effect of fluctuating versus constant temperature incubation regimes on sex ratios and other hatchling traits for both painted and red-eared slider turtles. Eggs were divided into two treatments with half of the eggs from each species incubated at a constant intermediate temperature, 28.5 degrees C, and half incubated under temperatures that fluctuated 3 degrees C above and below 28.5 degrees C. We converted the fluctuating temperature data into a constant temperature equivalent (CTE) so that we could directly compare constant and fluctuating incubation regimes. The CTE for the fluctuating regime for both species was higher than the constant temperature, which would predict an increase in the production of females.

Incubation length was nonlinearly sensitive to temperature, but it was not correlated with the thermal variance when holding the thermal mean constant.

Correlations of these variables with T(inc) could lend support to the hypothesis that TSD persists owing to sex-specific benefits of development at specific temperatures, whereas absence of T(inc) effects support the null hypothesis that TSD persists simply because selection favoring alternate sex determining mechanisms is weak or absent. The metabolic rate Q(10) value exhibited temporal variation and was higher immediately after hatching compared with 40 or 100 days posthatching, and mass conversion efficiency varied among clutches. Incubation temperature correlated inversely with duration of embryonic development, but did not influence yolk conversion efficiency, growth, or resting metabolic rate.

The effects of temperature on gonadal differentiation indicated that the upper pivotal temperature was approximately 27.5 degrees C. Posthatching growth was faster at warmer water temperatures, and there was little to no acclimation of metabolic rate to exposure to either incubation or water temperature. We conclude that intermediate (27.5 degrees-28.5 degrees C) incubation temperatures produce a female-biased mixed sex ratio and maximize hatching success and hatchling size while increasing incubation duration only slightly over that at the higher temperatures.

In oviparous species, the impacts of the developmental environment on offspring traits are mostly examined during development within the egg. However, as more than 25% of the development of squamate reptiles can occur prior to oviposition, we explored the effect of thermal conditions on development prior to oviposition in an oviparous snake species, the Children's python (Antaresia childreni). We housed gravid female pythons under three thermal cycles: an optimal regime that reflected maternal preference in a non-constrained environment (constant preferred body temperature of gravid females, T-set=31.5 degrees C) and two mildly suboptimal regimes that shared the same mean temperature of 27.7 degrees C, but differed in the duration at T-set. In one of the constraining regimes, females had access to T-set for 4. h daily whereas in the other regime, females never reached T-set (maximal temperature of 29.0 degrees C). Thermal treatments were maintained throughout gravidity in all three groups, but, after oviposition, all eggs were incubated at T-set until hatching. Compared with the optimal regime, the two suboptimal regimes had a longer duration of gravidity, which resulted in delayed hatching. Between the two suboptimal regimes, gravidity was significantly shorter in the treatment that included time at T-set. Furthermore, suboptimal regimes influenced offspring traits at hatching, including body morphology, antipredator behavior, strength and metabolism. However, partial access to maternal T-set significantly enhanced several offspring traits, including performance.

We examined the extent to which fluctuations in natural thermal conditions during pregnancy affect reproduction in a temperate viviparous snake, the aspic viper (Vipera aspis). Data gathered from a long term field study demonstrated that ambient thermal conditions influenced (1) female body temperatures and (2) gestation length, embryo viability, and offspring phenotypes. Interestingly, thermal conditions during each of the three months of gestation affected different aspects of reproduction. Hotter weather early in gestation (June) increased ventral scale counts (=number of body segments) of neonates; hotter weather mid-gestation (July) hastened development and thus the date of parturition; and hotter weather late in gestation (August) reduced the incidence of stillborn neonates.

However, it is unclear when this behaviour evolved relative to the evolution of viviparity. A preadaptation hypothesis suggests that maternal thermophily was a preadaptation to viviparity. Oviparous squamates are unique among oviparous reptiles for generally retaining their eggs until the embryos achieve one fourth of their development. As a result, maternal thermophily by gravid squamates may provide the same thermoregulatory benefits, at least during early development, that have been associated with viviparity. Thus, the evolution of viviparity in squamates may reflect an expanded duration of a pre-existing maternal thermoregulatory behaviour. Despite its evolutionary relevance, thermoregulation during gravidity in oviparous squamates has not yet been explored in depth. In the present study, we examined whether gravidity was associated with thermoregulatory changes in the oviparous children's python, Antaresia childreni. First, we discovered that, compared to most snakes, A. childreni is at an advanced stage of embryonic development at oviposition. Second, using surgically implanted temperature loggers, we detected a significant influence of reproductive status on thermoregulation. Reproductive females maintained higher and less variable body temperatures than nonreproductive females and this difference was most pronounced during the last 3 weeks of gravidity. Overall, these results highlight the continuum between oviparity and viviparity in squamate reptiles and emphasize the importance of thermal control of early embryonic development independent of reproductive mode.

The present study reports testosterone (T) levels to which embryos are potentially exposed in the green anole (Anolis carolinensis), a lizard with genotypic sex determination. We documented plasma and yolk T concentrations in adult females, in their developing follicles and eggs, and in freshly oviposited and incubating eggs. Plasma T was higher in reproductively active than in reproductively inactive females. Within reproductively active females, those with a single, large yolking follicle had higher plasma T than those that had one or more shelling, oviductal eggs. Individual females contributed different amounts of T to their yolks, but within females, more mature follicles or eggs consistently had higher yolk T concentrations than did less mature follicles or eggs. Similar to previous research, yolk T concentrations at oviposition were higher in male eggs than in female eggs. However, T levels during incubation did not differ by embryo sex, but rather increased in both male and female eggs. These results suggest that T plays a role in the reproductive physiology of females and potentially in the phenotypic development of their offspring. Furthermore, whereas the yolk T increase observed during follicular maturation is clearly a maternal influence, it remains unclear whether that observed during egg development (i.e., postfertilization) results from a lack of T uptake by the embryo as yolk is absorbed, from embryonic production of T that diffuses into the yolk, or from some combination of these processes. Because lizard embryos are comparatively well developed at oviposition, the assumption that yolk steroids are strictly of maternal origin may require modification, and the possibility that embryos are modulating their own steroid environment needs to be explored.

Especially at low incubation temperatures, individuals with scale asymmetries took longer to hatch than did symmetric conspecifics, were smaller in body length at hatching and were slower in trials of locomotor speed. Anti-predator tactics also covaried with scale asymmetry. These patterns suggest that individuals with asymmetric scales should have lower fitness and hence should rarely survive to adulthood in the wild. We tested this prediction by examining 201 field-collected snakes from museum collections. As predicted, scale asymmetries were seen primarily in small snakes, and rarely in larger animals.

While incubation experiments unambiguously show that constant high temperature accelerates development and shortens embryonic life, studies on the effect of fluctuating temperatures have generated contradictory results. Grass snakes (Natrix natrix) occur at latitudes and altitudes that are unusually cool for an oviparous reptile. In these cool climates females typically lay their eggs in heat-generating anthropogenic microhabitats that provide either a highly fluctuating (compost piles) or a relatively constant (manure heaps) thermal nesting environment. A laboratory experiment with fluctuating and constant incubation temperatures mimicking those recorded in such nests in the field showed that this nest-site dichotomy influences the development of the embryos, and the morphology and locomotor performance of the hatchlings. The incubation period increased at fluctuating temperatures and the fact that the rate of embryonic development showed a decelerating pattern with temperature suggests that periods of low temperature had a relatively larger influence on average development than periods of high temperature.

Our snakes resembled a previously studied population in lowland Sweden in terms of body size at sexual maturation in females (70 cm) and mean adult female body length (82 cm). However, growth rates were lower in our population, and sexual maturation was delayed (6-8 years, versus 4-5 years in Sweden), perhaps because of the cool climate and relatively brief growing period each year. Females produced a single clutch of 4-24 eggs in late July each year. Larger females produced larger clutches, but clutch size relative to maternal size was lower than in Swedish grass snakes. Hatchling sizes and Relative Clutch Masses (RCMs) did not shift with increasing female size. RCMs may provide a useful index of 'costs of reproduction' in this population, because females with high RCMs were very emaciated after oviposition, and hence may experience a greater risk of mortality, as well as a high energy expenditure. Prolonged incubation gave rise to longer, thinner hatchlings, but the low environmental temperatures at the study site may favour early hatching (and hence, result in a shorter fatter hatchling emerging from the egg, with more of its energy stores unused). Compared to sympatric viviparous snakes (Coronella austriaca and Vipera berus), the oviparous grass snakes can achieve a much higher reproductive output owing to a larger clutch size and more frequent reproduction (annual, rather than biennial or triennial).

We compared changes in heart rate (f (H)) and mean arterial blood pressure (P (M)) for chronically hypoxic and normoxic-incubated embryos after cholinergic and adrenergic blockade following three different acute temperature treatments: (1) 30 A degrees C (control incubation temperature), (2) acute, progressive decrease 30-24 A degrees C then held at 24 A degrees C, and (3) acute, progressive increase 30-36 A degrees C then held at 36 A degrees C. f (H) progressively fell in response to decreasing temperature and rose in response to increasing temperature. P (M) did not significantly change with decreasing temperature, but was lowered significantly with increasing acute temperature in the normoxic group at 90 % of development only. Propranolol administration (beta adrenergic antagonist) produced a significant f (H) decrease at 24, 30, and 36 A degrees C that was similar at all temperatures for all groups. For normoxic-incubated embryos at 90 % of development, atropine administration (cholinergic antagonist) significantly increased f (H) in both 24 and 36 A degrees C treatments, but not in the 30 A degrees C control treatment. This atropine response at 24 and 36 A degrees C demonstrated acute thermally dependent cholinergic tone on f (H) late in development for normoxic-incubated, but not chronically hypoxic-incubated embryos.

Longer periods of egg retention may require modifications to other reproductive features associated with the evolution of viviparity, including a reduction in eggshell thickness and clutch size. Field studies on the thermal and reproductive biology of high (HE) and low (LE) elevation populations of the oviparous lizard, Sceloporus scalaris, support these expectations. Both day and night-time temperatures at the HE site were considerably cooler than at the LE site, and the activity period was 2 h shorter at the HE than at the LE site. The median body temperature of active HE females was 2 degrees C lower than that of LE females. HE females initiated reproduction earlier in the spring than LE females, apparently in order to compensate for relatively low temperatures during gestation. HE females retained eggs for about 20 days longer than LE females, which was reflected by differences in the degree of embryonic development at the time of oviposition (stages 35.5-37.0 versus stages 31.0-33.5, respectively). These results support the hypotheses that evolution of viviparity is a gradual process, and is favored in cold climates. Females in the HE population exhibited other traits consistent with presumed intermediate stages in the evolution of viviparity; mean eggshell thickness of HE eggs (19.3 mu m) was significantly thinner than that of LE eggs (26.6 mu m) and the size-adjusted clutch sizes of HE females (9.4) were smaller than those of LE females (11.2).",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Egg incubation data unavailable1297,Matsuzawa,"Matsuzawa, Y; Sato, K; Sakamoto, W; Bjorndal, KA",2002,"Seasonal Fluctuations In Sand Temperature: Effects On The Incubation Period And Mortality Of Loggerhead Sea Turtle (Caretta Caretta) Pre-Emergent Hatchlings In Minabe, Japan",Marine Biology,140,3,639-646,10.1007/s00227-001-0724-2,"Incubation period., hatching success, and emergence percentage in loggerhead (Caretta caretta) nests were quantified during the 1993 and 1995 nesting seasons and following incubation seasons in Minabe, Wakayama, Japan.

Temperatures inside the nest chambers were a few degrees above those of the surrounding sand at the end of incubation. The incubation period ranged from 46 to 82 days. A significant negative correlation was found between mean sand temperature and incubation period. The relationship conformed to the day-degree concept. There was no significant seasonal trend in hatching success, but many pre-emergent hatchlings were found dead in most of the clutches during the warmest part of the season. Emergence percentage was correlated with mean sand temperature calculated for 4 days before emergence, suggesting that mortality may be due to heat. This heat-related mortality is considered to be a common phenomenon at our study site, because the peak in emergences coincides with the peak in high temperatures.

This energy constraint has affected the evolution of life history traits such as sexual maturity, clutch size, offspring size, reproductive effort, and fecundity. Limitations on the timing of reproductive events and the allocation of energy to offspring have a vital role in the fitness of the species, and it is expected that oviparous and viviparous lizards respond with inter- and intra-specific differences to different environmental conditions partly because of thermal constraints on the development of nestlings. We studied the reproductive cycles of two populations in Patagonia, Argentina (43 degrees and 46 degrees S), of each of three species: the southernmost oviparous liolaemids, Liolaemus bibronii, and Liolaemus boulengeri, and the viviparous Liolaemus lineomaculatus. The three species showed annual and synchronous reproductive cycles between males and females with birth or hatching occurring at the end of summer, showing common evolutionary paths in their reproductive biology.

Given that the incubation temperature can influence hatchling phenotype, understanding how elevated temperatures during development can affect the ability of hatchlings to undertake routine behaviours is important, especially for threatened species. Here we tested if raising mean incubation temperature above natural levels altered the physiology of hatchlings to an extent that behavioural function was impaired. Firstly, incubation temperatures were recorded from nests of the freshwater turtle (Elusor macrurus) in the wild, and the observed thermal range (26-31 degrees C) used to define the experimental protocol. Then, freshly laid E. macrurus eggs were collected and incubated at three constant temperatures (26, 29 and 32 degrees C). Embryos incubated at 32 degrees C had the lowest hatching success. Those that did hatch were smaller than the other groups and had a reduced post-hatch growth rate. On land, the ability of hatchling turtles to right themselves is critical, and the turtles incubated at 32 degrees C took 30-times longer to do this than those incubated at 26 degrees C. Once in the water, hatchling turtles must be able to swim effectively to evade predation and obtain food items. During swimming trials the 32 degrees C group exhibited a lower mean stroke force (10.5 +/- 0.3 mN) and spent less time swimming (133.7 +/- 17.7 s) compared with hatchlings incubated at 29 degrees C (13.4 +/- 0.4 mN, 281.3 +/- 25.7 s) and 26 degrees C (15.7 +/- 0.5 mN, 270.8 +/- 28.5 s).

During the temperature-sensitive period (TSP) of sex determination, we compared aromatase activity in the brain and gonads of putative male and female alligator embryos to determine if aromatase activity in the embryonic brain could provide the hormonal environment necessary for ovarian development in a TSD species. In addition, we assessed the pattern of aromatase activity in the brain and gonads of embryos treated with estradiol-17beta (E-2) and incubated at male-producing temperatures to compare enzyme activity in E2 sex-reversed females to control males and females. This has particular significance regarding wildlife species living in areas contaminated with suspected environmental estrogens. Gonadal aromatase activity remained low during the early stages of the TSP in both sexes and increased late in the TSP only in females. Aromatase activity in the brain increased prior to gonadal differentiation in both sexes. These results suggest that aromatase activity in the brain is not directly responsible for mediating differentiation of the gonad. E-2 exposure at male producing temperatures resulted in sex-reversed females that had intermediate gonad function and masculinized brain activity.

Three patterns of temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) have been defined, but one pattern where only males are produced above an upper temperature threshold (Type IB) is controversial. Here we report new data on the relationship between constant temperature incubation and sexual phenotype in two species of tuatara (Sphenodon), archaic reptiles of enormous zoological significance as the sole representatives of a once widespread reptilian order. RESULTS: In both species, the pattern observed with constant incubation temperatures from 18 to 23 degrees C (or 24 degrees C) supported a female-->male (FM or Type IB) pattern of TSD: in Sphenodon guntheri males were produced above a pivotal temperature of 21.6 degrees C, and in S. punctatus (unnamed subspecies on Stephens Island, Cook Strait), males were produced above a pivotal temperature of 22.0 degrees C. The pivotal temperatures and scaling parameters differed between species (p < 0.001). The thermosensitive period (TSP), where temperature influences gonad morphogenesis, occurs between 0.25 and 0.55 of embryonic development. While it is possible that the more common female-->male-->female (FMF or Type II) pattern exists, with a second pivotal temperature above 23-24 degrees C, we review several lines of evidence to the contrary. Most notably, we show that in S. punctatus, the warmest natural nests during the TSP produce predominantly males. CONCLUSION: An FM pattern of TSD could be currently adaptive in promoting sexual size dimorphism in tuatara. However, an FM pattern has particularly serious consequences for S. guntheri because current patterns of global warming could exacerbate the male bias already present in the relic population.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1307,Monasterio,"C.

We then investigated to what extent range limits of L.schreiberi coincided with those predicted from incubation experiments and actual temperature variation experienced in the field. This was done by intersecting documented presence localities of the species with interpolated spatial layers of soil temperature. Reproductive success (hatching success, morphological traits and growth rates) was strongly and negatively affected by high temperature. In contrast, incubation moisture only affected neonate size and its positive effects were only realized at moderate to low temperature. Documented temperature sensitivity suggests that successful embryonic development is likely to be compromised by available thermal conditions, and that this species is unable to colonize warmer areas such as those where L.schreiberi is absent beyond its distribution range limits.

Temperature is strongly coupled to elevation and greatly affects life history traits of oviparous reptiles in mountain environments. Thus, species may encounter barriers for expanding their ranges if they are unable to adapt to the changing thermal conditions encountered along elevational gradients. We sought to determine whether thermal requirements for embryonic development provide a plausible explanation for elevational range limits of two species of lacertid lizards that have complementary elevational ranges in a Mediterranean mountain range (Psammodromus algirus is found at elevations below 1600 m and Iberolacerta cyreni is found at elevations above 1600 m). We combined experimental incubation of eggs in the laboratory with modelled estimates of nest temperature in the field. In both species, increasing temperature accelerated development and produced earlier hatching dates. The species associated with warmer environments (P. algirus) experienced an excessive hatching delay under the lowest incubation temperature. Moreover, newborns from eggs incubated at low temperatures showed poor body condition and very slow rates of postnatal growth. In contrast, eggs of the strictly alpine species I. cyreni exhibited shorter incubation periods than P. algirus that allowed hatching before the end of the active season even under low incubation temperatures. This was countered by lower reproductive success at higher temperatures, due to lower hatching rates and higher incidence of abnormal phenotypes. Elevational range limits of both species coincided well with threshold temperatures for deleterious effects on embryonic development.

After that time, hatchlings emerge from the sand at night, both to avoid predation and to prevent overheating. Three hypotheses have been proposed regarding the thermal cues involved in emergence. Hatchlings emerge (1) after sand temperature falls below a critical threshold, (2) after a negative thermal gradient in the sand above the nest has been created, making upper sand cooler than sand below, or (3) in response to a rapid decrease in the temperature of the nest column. This study evaluated the cue(s) that loggerhead sea turtle Caretta caretta hatchlings use to emerge into a safe thermal environment. We collected thermal data at 5 depths in the sand from 150 loggerhead nests that had been relocated in Broward County, Florida. Hatchlings had a significant effect on sand temperatures due to metabolic heat. Therefore, to evaluate thermal cues, temperatures should be measured in nest columns and not adjacent to nests, as in previous studies. A critical threshold temperature existed, above which hatchlings did not emerge. The threshold temperature at 0 cm was 32.4 degrees C, which is similar to upper thermal thresholds of swimming activity for loggerhead and green turtle Chelonia mydas hatchlings measured in other studies. Most hatchlings emerged after a reversal in the thermal gradients between sand depths, but no particular temperature differential existed between those depths that cued emergence. A delay occurred after both threshold and reversal cues before hatchlings emerged, which may protect hatchlings under rapidly changing environmental conditions. Most hatchlings emerged sooner after the threshold temperature had been reached than after the temperature gradient had been reversed, but the 2 cues cannot be completely distinguished without further research. Rate of temperature decline was not a cue because most hatchlings emerged when rates were close to zero. We conclude that the critical threshold temperature is the most probable cue and that the most probable mechanism for controlling time of emergence is physiological - that is, a thermal inhibition of coordinated muscle movement so that emergence from the sand is only possible below a critical temperature threshold. Emergence data from in situ nests support these thermal patterns in relocated nests. These results have important implications for management of beach habitat for nesting sea turtles. Human impacts, such as beach renourishment and beach-front development, can change the thermal characteristics of the nesting environment, and therefore affect temporal emergence patterns of hatchlings.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Not applicable; Hatching behavior study1310,Moreno-Mendoza,"Moreno-Mendoza, N; Harley, VR; Merchant-Larios, H",1999,Differential Expression Of Sox9 In Gonads Of The Sea Turtle Lepidochelys Olivacea At Male- Or Female-Promoting Temperatures,Journal of Experimental Zoology,284,6,705-710,10.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19991101)284:6<705::AID-JEZ12>3.0.CO;2-1,"In mouse and chick embryos, the SOX9 gene is down-regulated in genetic females whereas in genetic males it remains in the Sertoli cells.

At stage 25 however, most medullary cells are SOX9 negative and at the female-promoting temperature, and from stage 26 onwards, SOX9 protein is not detected. At the male-promoting temperature, medullary cords remain SOX9-positive at all stages. These results suggest that SOX9 is up-regulated in Sertoli cells irrespective of primary sex-determining switch. Sex is irreversibly determined at stage 24 or 26 at the male- or female-promoting temperature, respectively (Merchant-Larios et al.,'97).

Specifically, females should lay large eggs in environments likely to produce the sex benefiting most from larger egg size. This relationship has been demonstrated in diamondback terrapins. To evaluate the generality of this hypothesis, we examined two components of this hypothesis using painted turtles (Chrysemys picta), a reptile with TSD. Vegetation cover around nests at oviposition significantly and negatively influenced nest temperatures during embryonic development, particularly during the period of sexual differentiation. However, no relationship existed between egg mass and either nest temperatures or vegetation cover around nests at oviposition. Therefore, large eggs were not laid in specific thermal microenvironments as a mechanism to match egg size with offspring sex ratio.

Incubation at the threshold, or pivotal, temperature (PvT) yields an even ratio of males and females. This strong susceptibility to temperature indicates that each embryo of this species is competent to develop as a male or a female. However, the mechanism that determines sexual fate at the PvT has not been identified. One possibility is that sexual fate is stochastic at the PvT, but coordinated by systemic signals within a single embryo. If this is the case, gonads explanted separately to culture should not coordinate their fate. Here we show that gonad pairs from embryos incubated at the PvT share a strong predisposition for one sex or the other when cultured in isolation, indicating that they were affected by shared genetic signals, maternally-deposited yolk hormones or other transient influences received prior to the stage of dissection. In ovo studies involving shifts from the male- or female-producing temperature to the PvT further indicate that embryos adopt a sexual differentiation trajectory many days prior to the onset of morphological differentiation into testes or ovaries and usually maintain this fate in the absence of an extreme temperature signal favoring the development of the other sex. Our findings therefore suggest that the outcome of sex determination in these reptiles is heavily influenced (i) by an inherent predisposition at the PvT and (ii) by the sexual differentiation trajectory established early in gonad development under male- or female-producing temperatures.

Long and short durations imply low and high temperatures, respectively. In turtle species whose sex is determined by temperature, males are produced at low temperatures and females at high temperatures.

Samples of hatchling loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) were collected from nests with known incubation durations, and sex was ascertained by means of histology. The sex ratio of groups of nests determined by histology was compared with that predicted from previous relationships between incubation duration and sex ratio. For conditions causing relatively long or relatively short incubation durations, the sex ratio could be predicted with considerable accuracy. For conditions causing durations nearer to the pivotal duration (that which gives 50% of each sex), predictions could be off by 10%, depending on the distribution of incubation durations, but it was still possible to determine whether ratios were highly skewed or approximately balanced.

The V-O2 rapidly increased beginning from incubation day 19 (D19) to a maximum on D50 and then decreased until pipping. The rapid V-O2 rise was correlated with an increase in the CAM surface and mass, heart mass, and ARC amplitude, whereas the functional parameters such as HR and ARC frequency remained unchanged. The drop in V-O2 before pipping was accompanied by a decrease in HR, while the heart and CAM masses were almost constant. In the cases of short-term temperature deviations of 3 degrees C from 28 degrees C, changes in V-O2 were significant until D50 and nonsignificant after that, the changes in ARC frequency and HR being significant at all stages studied. Thus, the developmental V-O2 changes were contributed mainly by the slow morphogenctic processes during D19-D50, whereas changes in functional parameters began to play a role at later stages.

Location This study was conducted on North Brother Island, Cook Strait, New Zealand. This 4-ha island supports the sole remnant population of S. guntheri. Methods Demographic variables were estimated using capture-recapture methods. Tuatara were individually marked and recaptured during twelve trips, spanning a decade. Population size was estimated for selected trips using the CAPTURE package and finite mixture models, and survival was analysed using the Jolly-Seber (J-S) model. Longevity was estimated using tuatara individually marked in 1957. Results Approximately 350 adult tuatara profile likelihood interval (PLI) (294-427) inhabit North Brother Island, and the sex ratio is strongly biased towards males (1.7M : 1F). Annual adult survivorship is high (0.95) for both sexes and some tuatara live for at least 61 years. Main conclusions The small size and biased sex ratio of this population may make it susceptible to demographic stochasticity, Allee effects, and/or loss of genetic variation.

Higher incubation temperatures produce males, and less than 1 degrees C separates production of males and females. We investigated variability in nesting ecology to assess whether global warming is likely to result in increasingly male-biased populations. We examined nesting seasons during 1998/1999 and 2002/2003 in New Zealand's largest tuatara population on Stephens Island, and collected hourly temperature recordings and physical descriptions from 70 nests. Nest depths were not significantly different between years, and ranged from 10 to 230 mm from the soil surface to the top egg. Incubation temperatures in successful nests throughout the year-long incubation period ranged from 1.6 to 38.4 degrees C. Sex ratios of nests were correlated with incubation temperature: 64% males were produced in 1998/1999, a relatively warm season, but we predict an equal sex ratio was produced in 2002/2003. Although temperatures varied over the 2002/2003 season with respect to monthly long-term averages, 2002 was the second warmest year on record. Stephens Island supports a wide range of nesting habitat, a relatively large population of tuatara, and nest characteristics are highly variable. As such, this population is likely to be resilient to global warming in the short term because an equal sex ratio was predicted from a relatively warm season. However, most other islands where tuatara occur are smaller, have smaller populations, and have fewer open areas for nesting and/or shallower soils. These conditions are more likely to produce a male bias in hatchlings because female tuatara do not appear to vary construction of nests with respect to temperature or location. in the extreme, this could lead to the extinction of small populations.

Examinations of stomach contents and fat body mass in the monthly samples suggest that food availability is not severely low for the geckos even during the winter, rejecting the previous assumption that food stress suppresses vitellogenesis in H. frenatus. No other environmental factors that may induce reproductive seasonality as phenotypic physiological responses were detected either. Tropical populations of H. frenatus and L. lugubris are known to lack distinct annual reproductive cyclicity. Thus, it is probable that the East Asian H. frenatus has evolved the winter quiescence of reproduction, presumably due to the poor embryonic tolerance of low temperatures. The absence of such seasonality in the sympatric L. lugubris seems to be attributable to its clonal nature which predicts the low genetic variability of the population from the colonization stage.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1331,Oufiero,"C.

Using realistic thermal conditions, we measured growth efficiencies and incubation periods of lizards from five populations representing two distinct clades. In both clades, embryos from cold environments (Indiana, New Jersey, and Virginia) grew more efficiently and hatched earlier than embryos from warm environments (Florida and South Carolina).

Our goal was to determine whether embryos in warm nests would expend more energy to develop than embryos in cool nests. We quantified metabolic rates during development, durations of incubation, and sizes at hatching. To describe changes in metabolic rate during incubation, we used the Akaike Information Criterion to determine the best statistical model among a set of six candidates. Once the best model was determined, the energetic cost of development was estimated by integrating metabolic rates over the period of incubation. We found that some form of sigmoidal model provided the best fit to the data for the majority of embryos (75%). Although embryos in the warmer treatment hatched earlier, the cost of development (approximate to 1.6 kJ) did not differ significantly between embryos in the two treatments.

Two-month-old caiman were raised at 2 different temperatures (29 and 33 degrees C) for 100 d.

Because low soil temperature may prevent successful development of embryos in eggs in nests, the geographic distributions of oviparous species may be influenced by the thermal requirements of embryos. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that low incubation temperature determines the northern distributional limit of the oviparous lizard Sceloporus undulatus. To compare the effects of incubation temperature on incubation length, egg and hatchling survival, and hatchling phenotypic traits, we incubated eggs of S. undulatus under temperature treatments that simulated the thermal environment that eggs would experience if located in nests within their geographic range at 37 degrees N and north of the species' present geographic range at latitudes of 44 and 42 degrees N. After hatching, snout-vent length (SVL), mass, tail length, body condition (SVL relative to mass), locomotor performance, and growth rate were measured for each hatchling. Hatchlings were released at a field site to evaluate growth and survival under natural conditions. Incubation at temperatures simulating those of nests at 44 degrees N prolonged incubation and resulted in hatchlings with shorter SVL relative to mass, shorter tails, shorter hind limb span, slower growth, and lower survival than hatchlings from eggs incubated at temperatures simulating those of nests at 37 and 42 degrees N. We also evaluated the association between environmental temperature and the northern distribution of S. undulatus. We predicted that the northernmost distributional limit of S. undulatus would be associated with locations that provide the minimum heat sum (similar to 495 degree-days) required to complete embryonic development. Based on air and soil temperatures, the predicted northern latitudinal limit of S. undulatus would lie at similar to 40.5-41.5 degrees N. Our predicted value closely corresponds to the observed latitudinal limit in the eastern United States of similar to 40 degrees N. Our results suggest that soil temperatures at northern latitudes are not warm enough for a sufficient length of time to permit successful incubation of S. undulatus embryos.

The aim is to understand how environmental temperature variations and nest heat conduction properties affect the long term dynamics of the population. This is a key to understanding how global temperature changes may affect their survival. With stochastic inputs of ambient temperature and solar radiation, the model uses the heat equation to determine the temperature in the egg layer in the nest; in turn, this determines the sex ratio in the egg clutch using a variable degree-day model. Finally, a nonlinear Leslie type, stage-based, two-sex model, is used to determine the long term male and female populations. A two-sex model is required because of different development rates for males and females. The model is flexible enough to enable other researchers to examine the effects of temperature variation variations on other species with TSD, e.g., crocodilians, reptilians, as well as other turtle species. It can be adapted to study effects of nest location, soil type, rain events, different incubation periods, and density effects, for example, the dependence of the mating function on the ratio of males to females and each's contribution to the sex of hatchlings. Modifications can be easily made to fit a specific life history traits. The model is a beginning step in understanding the long term, high fitness shown by many reptile species with TSD, and it may suggest to experimentalists what data may be relevant to these issues; it can also be useful to wildlife managers in developing strategies for intervention if needed. Among the principal findings are that temperature variability and detailed nest heat conduction properties may buffer projected negative effects on a population. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, constant incubation temperatures produced hatchlings with phenotypes favouring higher survival than fluctuating temperatures, but the effect of thermal variance was not as pronounced as the effect of thermal mean.

Feminization of gonads by exogenous oestrogens at a male-producing temperature and masculinization of gonads by antioestrogens and aromatase inhibitors a: a female-producing temperature have irrefutably demonstrated the involvement of oestrogens in ovarian differentiation. Nevertheless, several studies performed on the entire gonad/adrenal/ mesonephros complex failed to find differences between male- and female-producing temperatures in oestrogen content. aromatase activity and aromatase gene expression during the thermosensitive period for sex determination. Thus, the key role of aromatase and oestrogens in the first steps of ovarian differentiation has been questioned, and extragonadal organs or tissues, such as adrenal, mesonephros, brain or yolk, were considered as possible targets of temperature and sources of the oestrogens acting on gonadal sex differentiation. In disagreement with this view, experiments and assays carried out on the gonads alone, i.e. separated from the adrenal/mesonephros, provide evidence that the gonads themselves respond to temperature shifts by modifying their sexual differentiation and are the site of aromatase activity and oestrogen synthesis during the thermosensitive period. Oestrogens act locally on both the cortical and the medullary part of the gonad to direct ovarian differentiation. We have concluded that there is no objective reason to search for the implication of other organs in the phenomenon of temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles. Front the comparison with data obtained in other vertebrates, we propose two main directions for future research: to examine how transcription of the aromatase gene is regulated and to identify molecular and cellular targets of oestrogens in gonads during sex differentiation, in species with strict genotypic sex determination and species with temperature-dependent sex determination.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Review paper1357,Pieau,"PIEAU, C; GIRONDOT, M; RICHARDMERCIER, N; DESVAGES, G; DORIZZI, M; ZABORSKI, P",1994,Temperature Sensitivity Of Sexual-Differentiation Of Gonads In The European Pond Turtle - Hormonal Involvement,Journal of Experimental Zoology,270,1,86-94,10.1002/jez.1402700110,"In the European pond turtle, the incubation of eggs below 28 degrees C yields 100% phenotypic males, whereas above 29.5 degrees C 100% phenotypic females are obtained. Many data argue in favor of the involvement of steroid hormones in this phenomenon. During the thermosensitive period for sex determination, gonads are able to metabolize different steroid precursors, such as pregnenolone, progesterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone. Gonadal oestrogen content is higher at 30 degrees C than at 25 degrees C. When oestradiol benzoate (5 to 50 mu g) or oestrone (100 mu g) are injected into eggs incubated at 25 degrees C before or at the beginning of the thermosensitive period, gonads differentiate into ovaries instead of testes: an ovarian-cortex develops whereas medullary testicular cords are inhibited. Conversely, when tamoxifen (an anti oestrogen) is injected into eggs incubated at 30 degrees C, medullary testicular cords (or tubes) differentiate. Gonadal aromatase activity during the thermosensitive period increases in an exponential fashion at 30 degrees C, and remains very low at 25 degrees C. When eggs are first incubated at 25 degrees C up to a stage within this period, and then shifted to 35 degrees C (a highly feminizing temperature) for different times, the response is also exponential, showing an amplification of aromatase synthesis. Temperature could act, directly or indirectly, on the regulation of the expression of the aromatase gene. The anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) exerts an inhibitory effect on aromatase activity. The termination of the thermosensitive period could result in testes from an active synthesis of AMH, and in ovaries from high levels of oestrogens.

According to the maternal-preference offspring-performance hypothesis, females should choose oviposition sites that are optimal for offspring fitness. However, in thermally challenging environments, maternal oviposition behaviour may be constrained by the limited availability of suitable oviposition sites. We investigated nest-site selection in a nocturnal lizard [velvet gecko Oedura lesueurii (Dumeril and Bibron)] that inhabits a thermally challenging environment in south-eastern Australia. The viability of these gecko populations is critical for the persistence of an endangered snake species (Hoplocephalus bungaroides Wagler) that feeds heavily on velvet geckos. Female geckos chose nest sites nonrandomly, with 87% of nests (N = 30) being laid in deep crevices. By contrast, only 13% of clutches were laid under rocks, which were the most readily available potential nest sites. Nest success in crevices was high (100%), but no eggs hatched from nests under rocks. Temperatures in nest crevices remained relatively low and constant throughout the incubation period (mean = 22.7 degrees C, range 21.0-24.5 degrees C), whereas thermal regimes under rocks showed large diurnal fluctuations. Geckos selected crevices that were deeper, had less canopy cover, and were warmer than most available crevices; in 85% of cases, such crevices were used simultaneously by more than one female. The thermally distinctive attributes of nest sites, and their frequent communal use, suggest that nest sites are a scarce resource for female velvet geckos, and that the shading of rock outcrops through vegetation encroachment may influence nest success in this species.

Greater than 95% of the variation of the photosynthetic data could be accommodated by the Photosythesis-Irradiance (PI) model presented here. As expected, the shape of the PI-curves differed between shoots. The different shapes resulted from the different photosynthetic maxima and the efficiency with which shoots used light but not the amount of light required by the shoot to reach saturating light intensities. Irrespective of the units (whole shoot, leaf-chlorophyll content, or leaf surface area) used to generate the PI-curves, there was no significant(P > 0.05) difference between saturating light intensities (Ik), the mean value was 180 +/- 33 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). The quantity and quality of light available to these plants can modify leaf surface and chlorophyll content of seagrass shoots. Presenting the rates of photosynthesis as a function of chlorophyll or leaf surface area diminishes the ability to observe differences between plants. Hence, the health of seagrass plants may be more obvious and quantifiable if seagrass productivity data are expressed as a function of whole seagrass shoots rather than on the basis of chlorophyll content or leaf surface.

In the leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius), a species with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), hatchling sex ratios differ between incubation temperatures, as does sexuality in same-sex animals. This variation can primarily be ascribed to the temperature having direct organizing actions on the brain. Here we demonstrate that embryonic temperature can affect adult mate choice in the leopard gecko. Given the simultaneous choice between two females from different incubation temperatures (30.0 and 34.0 degrees C), mates from one incubation temperature (30.0 degrees C) preferred the female from 34.0 degrees C, while males from another incubation temperature (32.5 degrees C) preferred the female from 30.0 degrees C. We suggest that this difference in mate choice is due to an environmental influence on brain development leading to differential perception of opposite-sex individuals. This previously unrecognized modulator of adult mate choice lends further support to the view that mate choice is best understood in the context of an individual's entire life-history. Thus, sexual selection results from a combination of the female's as well as the male's life history. Female attractiveness and male choice therefore are complementary.

Eggs incubated at the three temperatures produced morphologically different hatchlings in P. versicolor but not in P. frontalis. Snout-vent length (SVL), body mass and head width were greater in P. versicolor hatchlings from the 24 degrees C treatment than those from the 32 degrees C treatment when accounting for differences in initial egg mass, and tail length was smaller in P. versicolor hatchlings from the 24 degrees C treatment than those from the 32 degrees C treatment when accounting for differences in final egg mass. Body mass, head length, head width, tail length, fore-limb length and hind-limb length were greater in P. frontalis hatchlings than in P. versicolor hatchling when accounting for differences in initial or final egg mass. Moreover, P. frontalis females produce larger hatchlings than do P. versicolor females of the same SVL not only by laying larger eggs, but also by investing more dry materials (and thus, more energy) into the egg. Given a link between interspecific competition (and niche restriction) and morphology, it seems likely that morphological differences at hatching may facilitate the coexistence of the two lizards. The two lizards differed in embryonic thermosensitivity and water uptake by eggs during incubation, suggesting that they use different microhabitats in the area of sympatry.

The ''cold climate'' hypothesis proposes that viviparity is adaptive in cold climates because developing embryos experience warmer temperatures in utero (through maternal thermoregulation) than they would in a nest. Most authors have assumed that these warmer incubation temperatures provide an advantage by protecting embryos from lethally low temperatures or by allowing them to hatch before the onset of winter. Thus, the ''cold climate'' hypothesis (at least in its traditional form) purports that viviparity evolves in cold climates because females that retain their developing offspring in utero will have greater reproductive success than females that lay their eggs in a nest. To test this hypothesis, I conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment using the reproductively bimodal Australian lizard, Lerista bougainvillii. Gravid oviparous and viviparous females were transplanted into field enclosures in both a ''hot'' and a ''cold'' climate, to monitor the effects of climate on their reproductive success. The live-bearers had higher reproductive success than the egg-layers in both climates, but reproductive success did not differ between the hot and cold climates within either reproductive mode. The viviparous lizards were more successful at producing offspring, regardless of climatic conditions.

In particular, the low nest temperatures associated with cold climate habitats are thought to be detrimental to the developing embryos or hatchlings of oviparous squamates, providing a selective advantage for the retention of developing eggs in utero, where the mother can provide warmer incubation temperatures for her eggs (By actively thermoregulating) than they would experience in a nest. However, it is not entirely clear M-hat detrimental effects cold incubation temperatures may have on eggs and hatchlings, and what role these effects may play in favouring the evolution of viviparity. Previous workers have suggested that viviparity may be favoured in cold climates because cold incubation temperatures slow embryogenesis and delay hatching of the eggs, or because cold nest temperatures are lethal to developing eggs and reduce hatching success. However, incubation temperature has also been shown to have other, potentially long-term, effects on hatchling phenotypes, suggesting that cold climates may favour viviparity because cold incubation temperatures produce offspring of poor quality or low fitness. We experimentally incubated eggs of the oviparous phrynosomatid lizard, Sceloporus virgatus, at temperatures simulating nests in a warm (low elevation) habitat, as is typical for this species, and nests in a colder (high elevation) habitat, to determine the effects of cold incubation temperatures on embryonic development and hatchling phenotypes. Incubation at cold nest temperatures slowed embryonic development and reduced hatching success, but also affected many aspects of the hatchlings' phenotypes. Overall, the directions of these plastic responses indicated that cold-incubated hatchlings did indeed exhibit poorer quality phenotypes; they were smaller at hatching (in body length) and at 20 days of age (in length and mass), grew more slowly (in length and mass), had lower survival rates, and showed greater fluctuating asymmetry than their conspecifics that were incubated at warmer temperatures. Our findings suggest that cold nest temperatures are detrimental to S. virgatus, by delaying hatching of their eggs, reducing their hatching success, and by producing poorer quality offspring. These negative effects would likely provide a selective advantage for any mechanism through which these lizards could maintain warmer incubation temperatures in cold climates, including the evolution of prolonged egg retention and viviparity.

There is increasing acceptance of the ideas that tests of adaptationist hypotheses should consider the importance of phenotypic plasticity for the traits involved, and explicitly incorporate the phylogeny of the organisms in question. 2. However, it is difficult to combine these two concepts. For many cases of major Life-history shifts, transitional forms displaying intermediate character states no longer exist, and thus their reaction norms cannot be measured directly. None the less, indirect tests may be done by using extant taxa on either side of the relevant transition. 3. This paper provides an example of such a test on a reproductively bimodal lizard species (Lerista bougainvillii, Gray 1839) to infer phenotypic responses to incubation temperature in the putative intermediate form between oviparity and viviparity. 4. By virtue of this tight taxonomic focus and parallel experimental manipulations of extant taxa, predictions of alternative adaptationist hypotheses on the selective forces responsible for this evolutionary transition, from incubation in the nest to incubation in utero, are tested. 5. By examining the responses of offspring phenotypes to experimental manipulation of incubation conditions in the extant oviparous and viviparous forms, it was possible to 'reconstruct' those of the now extinct transitional form. 6.

Reciprocal transplant experiments, in which organisms are moved from one area to another, offer a powerful technique to partition the effects of these two factors. However, many studies that have utilized this technique have focused on the post-hatching organism only and ignored potential effects of environmental influences acting during embryonic development. We examined the phenotypic responses of hatchling scincid lizards (Lampropholis guichenoti) incubated in the laboratory under thermal regimes characteristic of natural nests in two study areas in southeastern Australia. Although the sites were less than 120 km apart, lizards from these two areas differed in thermal regimes of natural nests, and in hatchling phenotypes (morphology, locomotor performance). We incubated eggs from each area under the thermal regimes typical of both sites. Some of the traits we measured (e.g. hatchling mass and snout-vent length) shelved little or no phenotypic plasticity in response to differences in incubation conditions, whereas other traits (e.g. incubation period, tail length, inter-limb length, body shape, locomotor performance) were strongly influenced by the thermal regime experienced by the embryo. Thus, a significant proportion of the geographic variation in morphology and locomotor performance of hatchling lizards may be directly induced by differences in nest temperatures rather than by genetic divergence. We suggest that future studies using the reciprocal transplant design should consider environmental influences on all stages of the life-history, including embryonic development as well as post-hatching life.

Incubation temperature may exert significant longterm phenotypic effects. Alternatively, such influences may be temporary, or negligible relative to effects induced by genetic factors, or by the environmental conditions experienced after hatching. Even if incubation temperature exerts long-term effects on phenotype, this might occur indirectly (by influencing hatching dates) rather than by direct modifications of developmental processes. We quantified the influences of the source population, incubation temperature and rearing environment, on the phenotype of the Australian garden skink (Lampropholis guichenoti) from populations that differ in nest temperature and phenotype. Interpopulation differences in the phenotypes of young lizards were found to be a product of all three Factors. However, the long-term effects of both population and incubation temperature operated indirectly (through variation in the date of hatching) rather than directly (through genetic or developmental factors).

Therefore, in this review, life history traits of C versicolor are compared to understand variation in life history with reference to their geographical distribution. The examination of C versicolor populations across its geographic range demonstrates considerable variation in some of the life history traits but not in all. For example, there is no sexual size dimorphism at hatching in one population but it is apparent in another. Body size, mass, reproductive output, influence of incubation thermal regimes on eggs and embryos differ between the populations. There is a trade-off between clutch size and egg size in one population but egg size is optimised in another. Lizards that belong to one population mature at a smaller size but at the same age compared to another population. Also, embryos exhibit high thermal tolerance in one population compared to another.

Our experimental studies now add a third mechanism to this list: sex determination via yolk allocation to the egg. Within each clutch, the eggs that produce daughters are larger than those that produce sons. If (and only if) eggs are incubated at low temperatures, removing yolk from a newly laid egg turns the offspring into a male. Adding yolk from a larger (but not smaller) egg turns the recipient egg's offspring into a female.

We experimentally tested nest-site choice in the long-lived turtle Chrysemys picta to determine whether nesting behaviour can compensate for potential skews in sex ratios caused by rapid climate change. We collected females from five populations across the species' range and housed them in a semi-natural common garden.

In particular variations in nest temperature may influence the rate at which embryos utilise their yolk energy. The effects of nest temperature on total energy use are however complex. High temperatures may advance development and shorten the time to hatching, thereby reducing energy use, but they also stimulate metabolic rate increasing energy use. The net effect of temperature on total energy demands is therefore uncertain. Oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and carbon dioxide production (VCO(2)) were measured by open-flow respirometry during the incubation of loggerhead sea turtle eggs at three temperatures (27.6, 30.0 and 31.8 degrees C). At each temperature, VO(2) and VCO(2) showed a peak followed by a decline to hatching. Incubation temperature was negatively related to incubation duration and positively related to the maximum metabolic rate of the embryos. Peak VO(2) was 74.8 ml/egg/day at 27.6 degrees C, 91.9 ml/egg/day at 30.0 degrees C, and 97.9 ml/egg/day at 31.8 degrees C. Peak VO(2) occurred closer to hatching in eggs incubated at higher temperatures. Total energy expenditure was greatest at the lowest incubation temperature and lowest at the highest temperature. Total VO(2) and VCO(2) were 1777 ml/egg and 1226 ml/egg, respectively, at 27.6 degrees C, 1680 ml/egg and 1235 ml/egg at 30.0 degrees C, and 1613 ml/egg and 1191 ml/egg at 31.8 degrees C.

At all temperatures, the calculated respiratory quotient values did not suggest that yolk substrates were oxidised proportionately, but more likely indicated their sequential use.

In contrast, species-typical aggressive displays were less sex specific and were activated by both dihydrotestosterone and testosterone (T) in males and by T in females. Nevertheless, the average duration of aggressive displays was significantly shorter in T-treated females than that in T-treated males.

Conversely, and across hormone treatments, males from a female-biased embryonic temperature mounted more than males from a male-biased embryonic temperature. Finally, treatment with 17 beta-estradiol decreased submissive behavior in males from a male-biased embryonic temperature compared with that in males from a female-biased embryonic temperature.

We found that 17 beta-estradiol (E-2) activated sexual receptivity in females but not males, suggesting an organized sex difference in behavioral sensitivity to E-2. There were also organized and activated sex differences in attractivity to stimulus males. Although females were more attractive than males when treated with E-2, both sexes were equally unattractive when treated with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or testosterone (T). Likewise, sex differences in aggressive and submissive behavior were organized and activated. Attacks on stimulus males were activated by T in males but not in females. In contrast, hormones did not influence flight behavior in males but did affect female submissiveness. Overall, males also evoked more attacks by stimulus males than did females. Nevertheless, females and males treated with androgens evoked more attacks than animals of the same sex that were treated with cholesterol or E-2. Incubation temperature had some weak effects on certain behaviors and no effect on others. This suggests that temperature effects in gonadally intact geckos may be due primarily to differences in circulating levels of hormones in adulthood.

We manipulated the hormonal environment in eggs of the common snapping turtle (Chelydra serpentina) to determine the effects of an estrogen (estradiol 17-beta), an aromatase inhibitor (fadrozole; CGS 16949A), and androgens (testosterone and dihydrotestosterone) on sex determination in this TSD species. Test solutions were applied topically to representative eggs (total tested = 1054 from 27 clutches) and incubated at two male-producing temperatures (24 and 26.5 degrees) and at a predominantly female-producing temperature (29 degrees). In this species, application of an estrogen induced female development at all temperatures tested. In contrast, the aromatase inhibitor had no effect at the male-producing temperatures, but induced male development at the predominantly female-producing temperature. At this temperature, aromatase inhibitor plus testosterone had a similar male-producing effect, but when applied alone, testosterone failed to augment male production. Dihydrotestosterone had a similar effect, in contrast to its reported androgenic effects in other TSD species. In the snapping turtle, male differentiation may not be androgen dependent; rather, it may proceed in the absence of female differentiation. In this species, female development is clearly estrogen-dependent and is altered by aromatase inhibition at female-producing temperatures. Our results not only provide additional evidence that sex steroids mediate gonadal differentiation in TSD species, but also suggest caution with respect to generalizations about the proximal mechanisms of TSD in reptiles.

Ambient temperature also affected growth: juvenile turtles grew slowly in a cool (19 degrees C) versus a warm (28 degrees C) environment.

Incubation temperature and gonadal sex jointly influence the display of sexual and agonistic behavior in adult leopard geckos. These differences in adult behavior are organized prior to sexual maturity, and it is plausible that post-natal hormones influence neural and behavioral differentiation. Here we assessed incubation temperature and sex effects on sex steroid levels in leopard geckos at 2, 10, and 25 weeks of age and monitored the development of male secondary sex structures. Males had significantly higher androgen concentrations at all time points, whereas females had significantly higher 17 beta-estradiol (E2) concentrations only at 10 and 25 weeks. Within males, age but not incubation temperature affected steroid levels and morphological development. Male androgen levels increased modestly by 10 and dramatically by 25 weeks of age, whereas E2 levels remained unchanged over this period. Most males had signs of hemipenes at 10 weeks of age, and all males had hemipenes and open preanal pores by 25 weeks of age. In females, age and incubation temperature affected E2 and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) but not T concentrations. Controlling for age, females from 34 degrees C have higher DHT and lower E2 levels than females from 30 degrees C. Further, E2 concentrations increased significantly from 2 to 10 weeks, after which E2 levels remained steady. Together, these results indicate that sexually dimorphic levels of steroids play a major role in the development of leopard gecko behavior and morphology. Furthermore, these data suggest that the organizational effects of incubation temperature on adult female phenotype could be, in part, mediated by incubation temperature effects on steroid hormone levels during juvenile development.

Controlling for reproductive status, plasma levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), testosterone (T), and progesterone (P) varied with incubation temperature but estradiol 17-beta (E2) levels did not. Controlling for the effects of incubation temperature, DHT and T levels were low when females were previtellogenic, increased slightly during early vitellogenesis, increased dramatically during late vitellogenesis (i.e., prior to ovulation), and then decreased to previtellogenic levels after ovulation. In contrast, E2 levels increased gradually from the previtellogenic stage to the early vitellogenic stage, peaked during late vitellogenesis, and decreased to previtellogenic levels after ovulation. Levels of P increased from the previtellogenic stage to the early vitellogenic stage, remained elevated during late vitellogenesis, and then decreased after ovulation. Moreover, we determined that females were not sexually receptive when previtellogenic, were somewhat receptive during early vitellogenesis (similar to 20% receptive), were most receptive during late vitellogenesis (similar to 80% receptive), and were again unreceptive after ovulation. Incubation temperature did not influence receptivity. Overall, these data show that hormone levels and behavior change coordinately during the reproductive cycle.

It has since been shown that TSD occurs in some fish, several lizards, tuataras, numerous turtles and all crocodilians. Extreme temperatures can also cause sex reversal in several amphibians and lizards with genotypic sex determination. Research in TSD species indicates that estrogen signaling is important for ovary development and that orthologs of mammalian genes have a function in gonad differentiation. Nevertheless, the mechanism that actually transduces temperature into a biological signal for ovary versus testis development is not known in any species. Classical genetics could be used to identify the loci underlying TSD, but only if there is segregating variation for TSD. Here, we use the 'animal model' to analyze inheritance of sexual phenotype in a 13-generation pedigree of captive leopard geckos, Eublepharis macularius, a TSD reptile. We directly show genetic variance and genotype-by-temperature interactions for sex determination. Additive genetic variation was significant at a temperature that produces a female-biased sex ratio (30 degrees C), but not at a temperature that produces a male-biased sex ratio (32.5 degrees C). Conversely, dominance variance was significant at the male-biased temperature (32.5 degrees C), but not at the female-biased temperature (30 degrees C). Non-genetic maternal effects on sex determination were negligible in comparison with additive genetic variance, dominance variance and the primary effect of temperature. These data show for the first time that there is segregating variation for TSD in a reptile and consequently that a quantitative trait locus analysis would be practicable for identifying the genes underlying TSD.

To assess the likelihood of geckos experiencing these temperatures in the wild, we compared the laboratory thermal regimes with data available for field microhabitat temperatures, body temperatures (T-b) and selected temperatures (T-set) of pregnant females. Temperature had a profound effect on the length and success of pregnancy: geckos from both populations under the cool regime had longer pregnancies that were less successful in producing developed neonates than geckos under the warm regime. Though no viable young were produced under the cool regime there were qualitative differences in outcome of pregnancies between populations all geckos from Alexandra (warm site) aborted pregnancies early on whereas several from Macraes (cool site) produced fully developed embryos after extremely long gestation periods (up to 440 days). Under the warm regime, populations appeared to differ in the rate of embryogenesis and in neonatal growth rate (both in g/day, with individuals from the Macraes population having the highest rates). Though temperatures of both thermal regimes overlapped with common microhabitat temperatures for both populations in most seasons of embryogenesis, maximum field T-b and T-set for pregnant females were generally higher than in the laboratory regimes, at least for certain times of day in warm weather. The prolonged embryogenesis exhibited by geckos under the warm regime and the poor success of pregnancy under the cool regime demonstrate the necessity of thermoregulation by pregnant females for successful reproduction, particularly at Macraes.

According to this hypothesis, and considering that viviparity would have evolved through a gradual increase in the extent of intrauterine egg retention, highland oviparous populations are expected to exhibit more advanced embryo development at oviposition than lowland populations. We tested for possible differences in the level of egg retention, embryo development time and thermal biology of oviparous Zootoca vivipara near the extreme altitudinal limits of the species distribution in the north of Spain (mean altitude for lowland populations, 235 m asl.; for highland populations, 1895 m asl.). Altitude influenced neither temperature of active lizards in the field nor temperature selected by lizards in a laboratory thermal gradient, and pregnant females selected lower temperatures in the thermal gradient than did males and nonpregnant females across altitudinal levels. Eggs from highland populations contained embryos more developed at the time of oviposition (Dufaure and Hubert's stages 3335) than eggs of highland populations (stages 3034) and partly because of this difference incubation time was shorter for highland embryos. When analysed for clutches from both altitudinal extremes at the same embryonic stage at oviposition (stage 33), again incubation time was shorter for highland populations, indicating genuine countergradient variation in developmental rate.

To test the role of gestation environment on embryonic development in oviparous Z. vivipara, we kept a number of gravid females at the temperature selected by non-gravid females in a laboratory thermal gradient, whereas control females were allowed to regulate their body temperature without restrictions.

Cloacal temperatures of gravid females active in the field were lower than those of males and non-gravid females, as well as the temperatures selected in a thermal gradient created in the laboratory (mean s.d.: 32.33 +/- 1.27 degrees C for gravid females; 34.05 +/- 1.07 degrees C for males and non-gravid females). Effects of temperature were assessed by incubating eggs at five constant temperatures (21, 25, 29, 32 and 34 degrees C). Incubation time decreased as temperature increased, following a negative exponential function. Incubation temperatures also affected the hatchlings' morphology: hatchlings incubated at 34 degrees C had shorter heads than those from other temperatures. Survival at 34 degrees C (58%) was significantly lower than at the other temperatures (mean 93%). Pregnant females select lower body temperature, approaching the temperatures that optimise hatchling phenotypes, according to predictions of the maternal manipulation hypothesis on the evolution of viviparity. The shift in preferred temperature by pregnant females would result in only a very short delay, if any, of hatching time and, because the temperature selected by pregnant females is much higher than average temperatures recorded in natural nests of Z. vivipara, egg retention considerably shortens incubation time, according to predictions of the cold-climate hypothesis.

Females with the ability to recognize environments that have a higher probability of producing the sex that would benefit the most from maternal condition will have an advantage. Using egg size as a maternal effect, I test this hypothesis in the diamondback terrapin, an emydid turtle with temperature-dependent sex determination. Terrapins have large variation in egg size among clutches and little variation within clutches. Egg mass is the primary determinant of hatchling mass and can result in as much as a three year difference in reaching minimum size of first reproduction in females, but may not affect age or size of first reproduction in males. Finally, terrapins select open nesting sites with warmer incubation conditions and place larger eggs there. Females place smaller eggs in cooler sites.

In the leopard gecko, Eublepharis macularius, the temperature of the egg during incubation not only determines gonadal sex, but also shapes the sociosexual behaviors, reproductive physiology, and hormone sensitivity of adult animals. In this study the effects of both incubation temperature and gonadal sex on functional connectivity among limbic brain areas were examined. Functional connectivity was assessed by analyzing covariance patterns in metabolic capacity, as revealed by quantitative cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. It was hypothesized that incubation temperature and gonadal sex affect the propensity to display aggressive or sexual behaviors by altering the functional connectivity within relevant neural circuits. The correlations of metabolic capacity between the anterior hypo-thalamus and both the septum and preoptic area were significant only in relatively aggressive individuals, suggesting that these circuits may regulate the phenotypic variation in aggressiveness caused by incubation temperature. The correlations between the ventromedial hypothalamus and both the dorsal ventricular ridge and septum were significant only in females, suggesting that these circuits may modulate female-typical sexual behaviors. Correlations among preoptic, hypothalamic and amygdalar areas tended to be distributed across both sexes, suggesting that there may be shared pathways underlying the expression of male-typical and female-typical behaviors.

The leopard gecko is a lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, and in this species, embryonic incubation temperature (IncT) affects the display of social behaviours. For example, adult males hatched from eggs incubated at an IncT that produces predominantly males (male-biased IncT, 32.5degreesC) are more aggressive and less sexually active than males hatched from eggs at an IncT that produces predominantly females (female-biased IncT, 30degreesC). It is not known, however, whether IncT influences behavioural plasticity in adulthood. We assessed whether adult males hatched from eggs incubated at female- and male-biased IncTs showed different changes in territorial behaviour (scent marking in an empty test arena), anticipatory behaviours (activity, scent marking and tail vibrations in response to cues that predict the introduction of a female) and courtship behaviour following social interactions with females. We found that heterosexual social experiences increased territorial behaviour and the display of anticipatory behaviours in males from the female-biased IncT but not in males from the male-biased IncT. This difference was not due to differences in the amount of social experiences acquired, and the greater change in anticipatory behaviour in males from the female-biased IncT suggest that they acquired sexual conditioning more readily. Differences in sex steroid concentrations or neural metabolism caused by IncT could underlie this difference. These results highlight the profound implications of maternal nest site selection for offspring phenotype and plasticity in this species. (C) 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Thin sections revealed that in dark-adapted retinas maintained at 22 degrees C, the neural processes which contact the cone cells at the invaginating synapses penetrated deeply into the photoreceptor endings. When dark-adapted retinas were illuminated for 1 h at 22 degrees C, the invaginating processes were apparently extruded from the synaptic endings. On the other hand, 1-h exposure to a temperature of 4 degrees C in the dark caused the invaginating processes to become much more strikingly inserted than at room temperature. A morphometric analysis showed that the ratio between the synaptic surface density of the endings and their total surface density decreased in the light and increased in the dark and cold. Freeze-fracturing documented fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane in all conditions tested. These observations suggest that the changes in configuration of the pedicles in the light, dark, and cold reflect a different balance between addition and retrieval of synaptic vesicle membrane from the plasmalemma; in the dark, the rate of vesicle fusion is increased, whereas in the cold, membrane retrieval is blocked. When the eyecups were warmed up and illuminated for 30-45 min after cold exposure, a striking number of vacuoles and cisterns appeared in the cytoplasm and coated vesicles were commonly seen budding from the plasmalemma. 60-90 min after returning to room temperature, the endings had reverted to their normal configuration, and the vast majority of vacuoles, cisterns, and coated vesicles had disappeared. When horseradish peroxidase was included in the incubation medium, very few synaptic vesicles were labeled at the end of the period of cold exposure. 30-45 min after returning to 22 degrees C, vacuoles and cisterns contained peroxidase, whereas most synaptic vesicles were devoid of reaction product. 2 h after returning to 22 degrees C, coated vesicles, vacuoles, and cisterns had disappeared and a number of synaptic vesicles were labeled.

Among vertebrates, individual sex (male or female) is primarily determined by either genes (genotypic sex determination, GSD) or embryonic incubation temperature (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD), and these mechanisms have undergone repeated evolutionary transitions. Despite this evolutionary lability, transitions from GSD (i.e. from male heterogamety, XX/XY, or female heterogamety, ZZ/ZW) to TSD are an evolutionary conundrum, as they appear to require crossing a fitness valley arising from the production of genotypes with reduced viability owing to being homogametic for degenerated sex chromosomes (YY or WW individuals). Moreover, it is unclear whether alternative (e.g. mixed) forms of sex determination can persist across evolutionary time. It has previously been suggested that transitions would be easy if temperature-dependent sex reversal (e.g. XX male or XY female) was asymmetrical, occurring only in the homogametic sex. However, only recently has a mechanistic model of sex determination emerged that may allow such asymmetrical sex reversal. We demonstrate that selection for TSD in a realistic sex-determining system can readily drive evolutionary transitions from GSD to TSD that do not require the production of YY or WW individuals. In XX/XY systems, sex reversal (female to male) occurs in a portion of the XX individuals only, leading to the loss of the Y allele (or chromosome) from the population as XX individuals mate with each other. The outcome is a population of XX individuals whose sex is determined by incubation temperature (TSD). Moreover, our model reveals a novel evolutionarily stable state representing a mixed-mechanism system that has not been revealed by previous approaches.

Previous analyses have assumed that intrauterine incubation enhances offspring survival because of early hatching or protection of the young in utero. I suggest instead that prolonged uterine retention directly enhances hatchling viability, because eggs incubated at maternal body temperatures produce ''better'' hatchlings than do eggs incubated at normal nest temperatures. To test this idea, I incubated eggs of two species of montane scincid lizards from southeastern Australia (Bassiana duperreyi and Nannoscincus maccoyi) under thermal regimes designed to simulate temperatures in nests and maternal oviducts. Hatchling phenotypes were substantially affected by incubation temperatures. The variables affected by incubation at maternal Versus nest thermal regimes include the hatchling's morphology (body size, relative tail length), running speed in a laboratory raceway, and behavior (activity levels, frequency of basking, antipredator tactics). The running speeds of hatchling B. duperreyi were also influenced by brief retention at ''maternal'' temperatures after the usual time of laying (a presumed intermediate stage for the evolution of viviparity) and by body temperatures of females prior to oviposition. Hence, a direct effect of uterine retention on offspring viability offers a plausible selective advantage for the evolution of viviparity in squamate reptiles and possibly in other Vertebrates and invertebrates also.

Many of these species avoid low incubation temperatures by selecting warm nest-sites, and the evolution of viviparity (by uterine retention and maternal thermoregulation) is an extension of this strategy. However, an alternative pathway exists: reptiles may adapt to low-temperature incubation rather than avoid it. The scincid lizard Nannoscincus maccoyi from high-elevation areas of south-eastern Australia follows this alternative strategy. Field studies show that Nannoscincus selects cooler oviposition sites than does the sympatric heliothermic skink Bassiana duperreyi, owing to differences in the type of cover object (log vs. rock), the size of cover object and the depth to which eggs are buried. These interspecific differences in natural incubation regimes are reflected in the responses of laboratory-incubated eggs to incubation temperature. Bassiana eggs tolerate higher temperatures than do Nannoscincus eggs, but do not develop as rapidly at low temperatures. Incubation at lower temperatures produces a larger, faster hatchling in Nannoscincus, whereas the reverse is true in Bassiana. Thus, Nannoscincus and Bassiana follow different pathways to overcome the difficulties of reproducing in cold climates.

Tinkle & Gibbons (1977) proposed that prolonged uterine retention of eggs (leading ultimately to viviparity) is favoured by natural selection when it allows the reproducing female to better predict the incubation conditions that will occur in alternative potential nest-sites, and hence select the optimal site in which to deposit her eggs. This ingenious hypothesis has never been tested empirically. Over a 7-year period, I monitored temperatures inside 124 natural nests of egg-laying scincid lizards at three different elevations in the Brindabella Range of south-eastern Australia. As a measure of thermal predictability, I used correlation coefficients from comparisons of temperatures early vs. later in incubation among nests within each site. Both the mean and standard deviation of nest temperatures were examined in this way for each week through incubation. I performed these calculations under two models: one where the female assesses nest temperatures at the time of oviposition only, and one where she monitors temperatures constantly from the usual oviposition date until the actual time of laying. These analyses falsified two major assumptions of the 'predictability' hypothesis. First, nest temperatures at higher elevations were no less predictable than were those at lower elevations; instead, predictability was high in all situations. Secondly, a longer delay before oviposition decreased rather than increased the predictability of thermal conditions during subsequent incubation.

Declining incubation temperatures might provide such a cue for montane lizards, because eggs that fail to hatch before winter will perish in the nest. I tested this idea by incubating eggs of an alpine scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi) in the laboratory. For the first half of the incubation period the eggs were kept at nest temperatures typical of those experienced in summer in the field (daily cycle of 18+/-7.5degreesC). I then transferred eggs at weekly intervals into cooler regimes (either 15+/-7.5degreesC; or with daytime temperatures unchanged but dropping to 0degreesC overnight). Contrary to prediction, the eggs did not hatch early. However, transfer to lower temperatures caused only a relatively short delay in hatching, because of a virtual temperature-independence of developmental rates late (but not early) in incubation. Decreasing incubation temperatures also modified hatchling running speeds and post-hatching growth rates, even if the thermal decrease occurred only shortly before the usual time of hatching. These processes plausibly affect hatchling fitness in cold-climate reptiles, and might be adaptations to montane habitats. Alternatively, they may prove to be widespread in other (warmer-climate) reptile taxa, in which case no adaptive hypothesis need be proposed.

Thermal advantages (eggs retained within the mother's body will be warmer than those laid in the nest) are almost certainly important, but the actual selective pressures remain controversial. For example, the benefit to retention might involve faster development, protection against freezing, predation, or desiccation, or modification of hatchling phenotypes. I experimentally manipulated incubation regimes of a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) to test these ideas. Eggs maintained in cooler ""nests"" in the laboratory developed more slowly, were more likely to die before hatching, and produced inferior (small, slow) hatchlings. A 2-wk initial period of higher-temperature incubation (simulating uterine retention, an intermediate step toward viviparity) ameliorated these effects. In the field, I placed eggs in artificial nests at the upper elevational limit of natural nests and also extending a further 100 m higher on the mountain. The results mirrored those in the laboratory: retention at maternal body temperatures accelerated hatching, enhanced hatching success, and increased locomotor speeds of hatchlings. This selective advantage of uterine retention was greater at higher elevations and increased with longer retention.

Explanations for this pattern have focused on the idea that behaviorally thermoregulating (sun-basking) pregnant female reptiles can maintain higher incubation temperatures for their embryos than would be available in nests under the soil surface. This is certainly true at very high elevations, where only viviparous species occur. However, comparisons of nest and lizard temperatures at sites close to the upper elevational limit for oviparous reptiles (presumably, the selective environment where the transition from oviparity to viviparity actually occurs) suggest that reproductive mode has less effect on mean incubation temperatures than on the diet distribution of those temperatures. Nests of the oviparous scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi showed smooth diet cycles of heating and cooling. In contrast, body temperatures of the viviparous scincid Eulamprus heatwolei rose abruptly in the morning, were high and stable during daylight hours, and fell abruptly at night. Laboratory incubation experiments mimicking these patterns showed that developmental rates of eggs and phenotypic traits of hatchling B. duperreyi were sensitive to this type of thermal variance as well as to mean temperature.

These traits may evolve sequentially as an oviparous lineage invades colder climates. To compare the thermal consequences of these adaptations, I measured microhabitat temperatures of potential nest sites and actual nests of oviparous scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi), and body temperatures of pregnant and non-pregnant viviparous scincid lizards (Eulamprus heatwolei). These comparisons were made at a site where both species occur, but close to the upper elevational limit for oviparous reptiles in south-eastern Australia. Viviparity and maternal basking effort had less effect on mean incubation temperature than did maternal nest-site selection. Eggs retained in utero experienced bimodal rather than unimodal diel thermal distributions, but similar mean incubation temperatures. Often the published literature emphasizes the ability of heliothermic (basking) reptiles to maintain high body temperatures despite unfavourable ambient weather conditions; this putative ability is central to many hypotheses on selective forces for the evolution of viviparity. In cold climates, however, opportunities for maternal thermoregulation to elevate mean body temperatures (and thus, incubation temperatures) above ambient levels may be severely limited.

The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of operative temperatures in terrestrial habitats also has favored careful nest-site selection and a matching of embryonic reaction norms to thermal regimes during incubation (e.g., via temperature-dependent sex determination). Many of the life-history features in which reptiles differ from endothermic vertebrates-such as their small offspring sizes, large litter sizes, and infrequent reproduction-are direct consequences of ectothermy, reflecting freedom from heat-conserving constraints on body size and energy storage. Ectothermy confers immense flexibility, enabling a dynamic matching of life-history traits to local circumstances.

An alternative possibility is that similar maternal thermophily may be widespread also in oviparous species and if so, would be a pre-adaptation (rather than an adaptation) to viviparity. Because eggs are retained in utero for a significant proportion of development even in oviparous reptiles, maternal thermophily might confer similar advantages in oviparous as in viviparous taxa. Experimental trials on montane oviparous scincid lizards (Bassiana duperreyi) support the pre-adaptation hypothesis.

Overall, incubation temperatures induced approximately half as much variance in hatchling phenotypes as did ''nest-of-origin'' effects.

Monitoring of 14 natural nests throughout most of the incubation period revealed considerable differences among nests in both means and variances of thermal regimes. Laboratory experiments on this species show that both the mean and the variance of incubation temperatures profoundly influence developmental rates (and hence, incubation periods) as well as the body shape, activity levels, thermoregulatory behavior, and running speeds of the hatchlings. Hence, a female's selection of a particular nest site can substantially modify both the time of emergence of the hatchlings, and the morphology and behavior of her offspring. Even within a single nest, minor differences among eggs in their depth below the ground surface will directly affect thermal variance, and so may strongly influence rates of embryogenesis and the phenotype of the hatchling.

Neonates from females with lesser basking opportunities were relatively short and fat, were very active, and were relatively fast runners. Effects of the embryos' thermal regime on the young lizards' morphology and running speed were still detectable two months after birth. Thus, much of the morphological and behavioral variation among neonatal reptiles may arise from phenotypically plastic responses to the thermal environments experienced during embryonic development, rather than from heritable genetic differences among individuals.

In contrast, water pythons (Liasis fuscus) in northern Australia are tropical snakes that show facultative maternal brooding, with shivering thermogenesis to warm the clutch. Thus, incubation temperatures of this species are influenced both by nest site selection and by maternal care. We experimentally simulated three thermal regimes typical of different types of natural nests in our study population. These were (1) hot, stable temperatures typical of nests laid in the burrows of varanid lizards (constant 32 degrees C); (2) lower and more variable temperatures typical of nests laid inside tree root boles, either with maternal attendance (diel range 27.1 degrees - 32.9 degrees C); or (3) in root boles but without maternal attendance (24.3 degrees - 32.9 degrees C). We incubated 187 eggs from 15 clutches obtained from field-caught gravid pythons, using a split-clutch design to quantify influences on morphology (offspring size and shape), locomotor performance (swimming ability), and behavior (escape tactics, propensity to strike, willingness to feed in captivity). The thermal regime during incubation strongly affected incubation periods, body sizes, body shapes (mass and tail length relative to snout-vent length), initial growth rates, escape behavior, and willingness to feed. We also detected strong maternal effects on all of these traits, and interactions between maternal effects and incubation regimes.

This hypothesis predicts enhanced neonatal performance after more prolonged incubation or gestation, within as well as among populations. Both published and original data on Australian scincid lizards support this prediction. In a field study, viviparous alpine skinks (Niveoscincus microlepidotus) that gave birth later in the season had faster-running offspring, that had a higher probability of surviving through the first year of life. The enhanced performance and survival were not secondary results of larger offspring size.

The study involved two populations of each species along an altitudinal gradient in southern California and one population of S. occidentalis from Oregon. In the field daily activity time varied seasonally: activity periods were short during spring and fall and longer during the summer. Activity patterns also varied geographically: in montane and high-latitude environments, hatchlings experienced reduced opportunity for growth both daily and seasonally, because fewer, shorter days are available before the end of the activity season. We conducted laboratory experiments to measure the effect of the thermal environment on hatchling growth rates. Laboratory-incubated hatchlings had access to radiant energy for part of each day and were kept at 15-degrees-C (too low for activity) the rest of the day. The four experimental treatments (6, 9, 12 and 15 h of radiant energy per day) approximated the range of thermal environments encountered by hatchlings in the wild. Food and water were provided ad libitum. Mass-specific growth rates were plastic and generally increased with potential activity time in hatchlings from all populations. However, the form of this relationship varied among populations: growth rates of California S. occidentalis (''growth opportunists'') increased roughly linearly with potential activity time, whereas growth rates of Oregon S. occidentalis and California S. graciosus (''short-day specialists'') showed curvilinear responses to potential activity time. Interspecific and large-scale intraspecific differences in the form of the norm of reaction paralleled the differences in thermal environments encountered by hatchlings in nature. Populations of S. occidentalis at low elevation in California routinely experience short and long days of activity (e.g., 6-13 h/d) and the norm of reaction for growth rate increases linearly over this range. In contrast, populations of S. graciosus rarely experience days with > 9 h of activity and the norm of reaction for growth rate plateaus above 9 h/d. Similarly, nor-them populations of S. occidentalis from Oregon rarely experience days with > 9 h of activity and the norm of reaction for growth rate also plateaus above 9 h/d. On a large scale, therefore, growth responses appear to be appropriate to the thermal environments to which hatchlings are most commonly exposed. However, conspecific populations from different altitudes in California did not differ in growth response, although hatchlings experience different thermal environments in nature. We observed substantial among-family variation in growth rates of S. occidentalis, which may indicate genetic variation, a prerequisite for evolution by natural selection. Moreover, significant family x treatment interaction effects on growth rate that reflect underlying genotype x environment interactions indicate a genetic basis to the observed intraspecific and interspecific differentiation in the norm of reaction.

Embryos incubated at 30 degrees C develop ovaries and hatch as females while most embryos incubated at 32-32.5 degrees C develop testes and hatch as males. Several lines of evidence suggest that estrogen is involved in gonadal sex differentiation in crocodilians and other reptiles with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). In vivo autoradiography was used here to identify sites of H-3-estradiol uptake in the urogenital tissues of C. porosus embryos incubated at 30 degrees C (female-producing) and at 32.5 degrees C (predominantly male-producing). During the period of gonadal differentiation (developmental stage 23), H-3-estradiol was specifically concentrated in the gonads of presumptive females at 30 degrees C and presumptive males at 32.5 degrees C. Binding was localised primarily in the medulla of the gonad in both sexes, with little or no uptake in the cortex. No uptake was detected in the adjoining adrenal glands, at either temperature, although some uptake was observed in the mesonephros at the female temperature (30 degrees C). No specific binding of estradiol by the gonads was found prior to (stage 19) or after (stage 28) the period of gonadal differentiation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that estrogen binding sites are present in the gonads of both sexes during a specific period of embryogenesis, which coincides with the time of gonadal sex differentiation. Furthermore, these observations suggest that the role of estrogen in TSD is not mediated through differential uptake of the steroid by presumptive ovaries and testes. It is therefore hypothesised that estrogen synthesis is temperature-sensitive, rather than estrogen binding by the gonad.

In particular, synchrony in the timing of births may have evolved as a predator-avoidance strategy as it dilutes the risk of predation upon vulnerable newborn and naive young. Eggs of an Australian Freshwater turtle, Emydura macquarii, can hatch synchronously despite developmental asynchrony among eggs of a clutch and hatchlings have a reduced predation risk by emerging from the nest as a group. Developmental asynchrony within clutches was induced to reflect natural nests by dividing clutches and incubating them at either 25 degreesC or 30 degreesC. Some eggs were then reunited with their clutch-mates and hatching occurred synchronously in some of these groups. In groups where synchronous hatching did not occur, less advanced eggs still hatched earlier than the normal incubation period. Synchrony occurred because the less advanced eggs hatched up to five days earlier than the control embryos.

Here we present results of paired, large-scale, five-year field experiments to identify causes of variation in individual growth and survival rates of an Australian turtle (Emydura macquarii) prior to maturity. To distinguish between these competing hypotheses, we reduced nest predators in two populations and retained a control population to create variation in juvenile density by altering recruitment levels. We also conducted a complementary split-clutch field-transplant experiment to explore the impact of incubation temperature (25 degrees C or 30 degrees C), nest predator level ( low or high), and clutch size on juvenile growth and survival. Juveniles in high-recruitment ( predator removal) populations were not resource limited, growing more rapidly than young turtles in the control populations. Our experiments also revealed a remarkably long-term impact of the thermal conditions experienced during embryonic development on growth of turtles prior to maturity. Moreover, this thermal effect was manifested in turtles approaching maturity, rather than in turtles closer to hatching, and was dependent on population density in the post-hatching rearing environment. This apparent phenotypic plasticity in growth complements our observation of a strong, positive genetic correlation between individual body size in the experimental and control populations over the first five years of life (r(G) similar to +0.77).

Hatchlings from eggs incubated at 32.8 and 35.3 C were significantly smaller than hatchlings from eggs incubated at 28.1 and 30.6 C. Hatching mass had no effect on growth rate of hatchlings.

The most pervasive candidates are: (1) androgen-mediated control of growth, i.e. a positive effect of gonadal androgens (testosterone) on male growth in male-larger species, and a negative effect in female-larger species; and (2) sex-specific differences in energy allocation to growth, e.g. sex with larger reproductive costs should result in smaller body size. We tested these hypotheses in adults of the male-larger lizard Paroedura picta by conducting castrations with and without testosterone implants in males and manipulating reproductive status in females. Castration or testosterone replacement had no significant effect on final body length in males. High investment to reproduction had no significant effect on final body length in intact females. Interestingly, ovariectomized females and females with testosterone implants grew to larger body size than intact females. We did not find support for either of the above hypotheses and suggest that previously reported effects of gonadal androgens on growth in male lizards could be a consequence of altered behaviour or social status in manipulated individuals. Exogenous testosterone in females led to decreased size of ovaries; its effect on body size may be caused by interference with normal ovarian function. We suggest that ovarian factors, perhaps estrogens, not reproductive costs, can modify growth in female lizards and may thus contribute to the development of SSD. This hypothesis is largely supported by published results on the effect of testosterone treatment or ovariectomy on body size in female squamates.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Not a relevant study1454,Steyermark,A.

In some turtle species, temperature preference may be influenced by embryonic and post-hatching conditions, such as egg-incubation and acclimation temperature. We tested for effects of embryonic incubation temperature (27.5 degrees C, 30 degrees C) and acclimation temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C) on the selected temperature and movement patterns of 32 Chrysemys picta bellii (Reptilia: Emydidae) hatchlings in an aquatic thermal gradient of 14-34 degrees C and in single-temperature (20 degrees C, 25 degrees C) control tests. Among 10-11 month old hatchlings, acclimation temperature and egg-incubation temperature influenced temperature selection and movement patterns. Acclimation temperature affected activity and movement: in thermal gradient and single-temperature control tests, 25 degrees C-acclimated turtles relocated between chambers significantly more frequently than individuals acclimated to 20 degrees C. Acclimation temperature also affected temperature selection: 20 degrees C-acclimated turtles selected a specific temperature during gradient tests, but 25 degrees C-acclimated turtles did not. Among 20 degrees C-acclimated turtles, egg-incubation temperature was inversely related to selected temperature: hatchling turtles incubated at 27.5 degrees C selected the warmest temperature available (34 degrees C); individuals incubated at 30 degrees C selected the coldest temperature (14 degrees C).

In the present study, we focused on a population of a viviparous lizard with TSD (Eremias multiocellata) that lives at high altitudes ( approximate to 2900 m) in Tianzhu, Gansu province, China. Gestation temperature had a notable effect on the offspring sex ratio, gestation period, and the mother's body mass. The mothers produced female biased offspring at 25 degrees C but male biased offspring at 35 degrees C. All female lizards lost weight during pregnancy, and the least loss of the body mass was observed at 31 degrees C. The gestation period increased in a non-linear fashion as ambient temperature was reduced. Average litter size was elevated with an increase of gestation temperatures, reached a maximum at 31 degrees C, and then declined at 35 degrees C. Compared with a previous study on a Minqin population which lives at a lower altitude ( approximate to 1400 m) and warmer climate, the present study obtained a less skewed sex ratio of offspring in the Tianzhu population. Geographic variations also affected offspring morphology between the two populations; females collected from Tianzhu produced larger litters but with a smaller body weight of offspring. These differences may be caused by the adaptive response to the cool climatic and high-altitude environmental conditions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a modified constant temperature equivalent model that accounts for the effect of the interaction among climate change, oviposition date, and seasonal thermal pattern on temperature during sexual differentiation and thus on offspring sex ratio. Our results suggest that females will not be able to buffer their progeny from the negative consequences of climate change by adjusting nesting date alone. Not only are offspring sex ratios predicted to become 100% female, but our model suggests that many nests will fail.

Therefore, apparently 'risky' behaviours should only be stably maintained in a population if they confer a fitness advantage. Here, we experimentally examined the adaptive function of tail waving, an apparently risky antipredator behaviour in hatchling Australian three-lined skinks, Bassiana duperreyi, by determining the effects of running speed, incubation temperature, sex and parental environment on the frequency of tail waving in laboratory trials. We found that hatchling running performance predicted tail-waving behaviour independent of the other factors, where slow individuals tail-waved more frequently than fast individuals. These data support the hypothesis that tail waving functions to deflect predatory attacks towards the tail, an expendable body part in this and other lizard species. Moreover, we suggest that tail waving in this species occurs as a 'last resort' in response to fatigue. In addition, our results allow us to reject the hypothesis that tail waving primarily functions as a pursuit-deterrent signal in hatchling B. duperreyi.

Whether or not climate change affects sex ratio depends upon the effectiveness of buffering mechanisms that link ambient regimes to actual nest temperatures. For example, females may simply lay nests earlier in the season, or in more shaded areas, such that incubation thermal regimes are unchanged despite massive ambient fluctuation. Based on eight years of monitoring nests over a 10-year period in the field at an alpine site in southeastern Australia, we show that, even though lizards (Bassiana duperreyi, Scincidae) have adjusted both nest depth and seasonal timing of oviposition in response to rising ambient temperatures, they have been unable to compensate entirely for climate change. That inability stems from the fact that the seasonal progression of soil temperatures, and thus, the degree to which thermal regimes at the time of laying predict subsequent conditions during incubation, also has shifted with climate change.

Embryonic development at oviposition was more advanced in eggs laid by females from high-elevation populations than in eggs produced by females from lower elevations. In the laboratory, experimentally imposed low maternal body temperatures delayed oviposition and resulted in more advanced embryonic development at oviposition.

We found that nests exposed to extreme hot temperatures for >60 h produced more hatchlings with abnormalities than nests exposed to extreme hot temperatures for shorter periods, regardless of whether or not nesting females displayed abnormal morphologies. We observed no effect of extreme cold nest temperatures on the occurrence of hatchlings with abnormalities. Moreover, the frequency of nesting females with abnormal shell morphologies was approximately 2-fold lower than that of their offspring, suggesting that such abnormalities are negatively correlated with survival and fitness. Female turtles could potentially buffer their offspring from extreme heat by altering aspects of nesting behavior, such as choosing shadier nesting sites. We addressed this hypothesis by examining the effects of shade cover on extreme nest temperatures and the occurrence of hatchling abnormalities. While shade cover was negatively correlated with the occurrence of extreme hot nest temperatures, it was not significantly correlated with abnormalities. Therefore, female choice of shade cover does not appear to be a viable target for selection to reduce hatchling abnormalities.

To address these issues, we investigated the determinants of sex ratios in the mallee dragon Ctenophorus fordi, together with a detailed analysis of karyotypes. There was no detectable variation in sex ratios arising from variation among females, clutches or incubation temperatures, which might indicate genetic sex determination for this species. However, there was no evidence of cytologically distinct sex chromosomes using standard banding techniques.

Poor thermal opportunity decreased birth weight at low altitudes where selection on body mass was negligible. In contrast, there was no effect of maternal thermal opportunity on body mass at high altitudes where natural selection favored heavy offspring. The weaker effect of poor maternal thermal opportunity on offspring development at high altitude was accompanied by a more active thermoregulation and higher body temperature in highland females. This may suggest that passive effects of temperature on embryonic development have resulted in evolution of adaptive behavioral compensation for poor thermal opportunity at high altitudes, but that direct effects of maternal thermal environment are maintained at low altitudes because they are not selected against.

Determining TSD thermal ecology is important to understanding sex ratio evolution in those species, as TSD systems may pose a challenge to Fisherian models that predict the production of 1:1 sex ratios through frequency-dependent selection. Unfortunately, the relationship between fluctuating temperatures and sex in nature remains poorly understood. Here I present a novel statistical model of TSD in the endangered Amazonian freshwater turtle, Podocnemis expansa. designed to account for heterogeneous daily fluctuations of natural nest temperatures by comparing laboratory and field data on sex ratios, developmental stages, cumulative temperature units (CTUs), and time spent below the survival threshold (28 degreesC). Experiments encompassed constant, shift-once, and shift-twice temperatures in the laboratory, plus depth and shading treatments in the field. A constant temperature of 32.6 degreesC produced 1: 1 males : females, the highest pivotal temperature ever reported for a turtle species. The thermosensitive period for sex determination (TSP) roughly occurs during developmental stages 17-24 as determined from shift experiments. The CTUs during the TSP plus the number of hours below 28 degreesC prior to the TSP significantly explained sex ratio production in the combined laboratory and field data set (positive and negative effects, respectively). However, the relationship for field nests only was not significant. Higher temperatures had a disproportionately larger effect on female production in the combined field and laboratory data set. Depth and shading had drastic effects on nest temperature, embryonic development, and sex ratio. Seasonal climate changes can override the effect of nest depth via differences in oviposition time. Two of the shaded nests experienced the coldest temperatures of all field nests but yielded the highest female proportion, according to a TSDII pattern (when females are produced at low and high temperatures and males are produced at intermediate temperatures). Thus Podocnemis expansa may be a TSDII species, but this intrinsic system seems to be realized as TSDIa in nature (males produced at low temperatures and females produced at high temperatures), because of the general lethality of cold temperatures which precludes the production of low-temperature females.",Partially,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,N,Did not use temperature-shift or natural temperature data that was present in this paper.1478,Valenzuela,"Valenzuela, N",2001,Maternal Effects On Life-History Traits In The Amazonian Giant River Turtle Podocnemis Expansa,Journal of Herpetology,35,3,368-378,10.2307/1565954,"Energy allocation to eggs and nest site selection by females can affect life-history variables such as offspring size, offspring number, developmental rate, survivorship, growth rate, and performance in oviparous reptiles. Nest site selection can affect offspring phenotype by altering incubation conditions. I present evidence of a positive effect of female size on clutch size, egg mass, and nest depth through the study of trackways left by female river turtles, Podocnemis expansa, on their nesting beaches. Larger females laid larger clutches composed of larger eggs, which were buried deeper than clutches laid by smaller females. The data suggest that P expansa does not conform to optimal propagule size models. Neither egg size nor clutch size reached a plateau as female size increased. Females seem to allocate the extra energy (in absolute terms) gained allometrically with increasing size and age to both number and size of eggs. There was no evidence of a trade-off between egg size and number after removing the effect of female size. Larger eggs produced larger hatchlings that survived better but grew less than individuals of smaller initial size during the first two months of life, under unlimited food conditions. I suggest that fitness of female P expansa increases by producing larger eggs because of the advantage that larger hatchlings have in survival. Deeper nests experience cooler temperatures and tend to produce a higher percentage of males than more superficial nests. Therefore, there is a potential for important effects of nest depth on sex ratios produced by different sized females within the population and possibly by single females throughout their lifetime.

Of particular interest is the relative role that the environment and the genome play in directing gonadal formation, especially the effect of environmental temperature in directing this process in vertebrates. Comparative analyses in closely related taxa with contrasting sex-determining mechanisms should help fill this gap. Here I present a multivariate study of the regulation of the gene network underlying sexual development in turtles with temperature-dependent (TSD; Chrysemys picta) and genotypic sex determination (GSD; Apalone mutica). I combine novel data on SOX9 and DMRT1 from these species with contrasting sex-determining mechanisms for the first time with previously reported data on DAX1, SF-1 (NR5A1), WT1, and aromatase (CYP19A1) from these same taxa. Comparative expression analyses of SOX9 and DMRT1 from these and other species indicate additional elements whose expression has diverged among TSD taxa, further supporting the notion that significant evolutionary changes have accrued in the regulation of the TSD gene network in reptiles. A non-parametric MANOVA revealed that temperature had a significant effect in multivariate gene expression in C. picta that varied during embryonic development, whereas the covariation of gene expression in A. mutica was insensitive to temperature. A phenotypic trajectory analysis (PTA) of gene expression comparing both species directly indicated that the relative covariation in gene expression varied between temperatures in C. picta. Furthermore, the 25 degrees C trajectory of C. picta differed from that of A. mutica in the magnitude of gene expression change. Additional analyses revealed a stronger covariation in gene expression and a more interconnected regulatory network in A. mutica, consistent with the hypothesis that sexual development is a more canalized process in A. mutica, as would be expected if GSD evolved in this lineage through directional selection from its TSD ancestor.

Here we examined the expression of an important gene for sexual differentiation common to both systems, Sf1, at male- and female-producing temperatures, in TSD (Chrysemys picta) and GSD turtles (Apalone mutica). We tested the hypotheses that Sf1 expression responds to temperature consistently across TSD turtles but is unaffected in GSD turtles, and that this differential expression starts no earlier than the onset of the thermosensitive period (TSP). As expected, Sf1 expression was thermally insensitive in A. mutica (GSD). Although Sf1 exhibited a differential expression by temperature in C. picta, the expression pattern differed from other TSD turtles (Trachemys scripta), perhaps reflecting divergence of the gene regulatory networks underlying sex determination over evolutionary time. Most notably, Sf1 was differentially expressed in C. picta (significantly higher at the male-producing temperature) before the onset of the TSP, implying that in TSD taxa significant thermal effects may occur early in development. This result may reconcile field observations where temperatures experienced prior to the TSP have an effect on sex ratios, thus challenging traditional TSP models. Importantly, the molecular factors that render TSD mechanisms thermosensitive remain unknown, and potential candidates are genes that express differentially before the onset of the TSP (genes shaping or opening the TSP-window rather those acting once the TSP window has opened).

When the hatchlings emerged, a sample of the clutch was run, measured and weighed and a separate sample was examined histologically for sex characteristics. Nest temperatures ranged between 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C and generally showed increases over the second half of incubation due to metabolic heating of the clutch.

Nests at a depth of 75 cm had significantly lower daily temperature ranges than nests at a depth of 50 cm, but a maximum mean daily range of 0.5 degrees C (50 cm depth in 70% shade hatchery) resulted in calculated constant temperature equivalents (CTE) being identical to observed mean nest temperatures.

The Charnov-Bull model suggests that temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) can enhance maternal fitness relative to genotypic sex determination (GSD) if offspring traits affect fitness differently for sons versus daughters and nest temperatures either determine or predict those offspring traits. Although potential pathways for such effects have attracted much speculation, empirical tests largely have been precluded by logistical constraints (i.e., long life spans and late maturation of most TSD reptiles). We experimentally tested four differential fitness models within the Charnov-Bull framework, using a short-lived, early-maturing Australian lizard (Amphibolurus muricatus) with TSD. Eggs from wild-caught females were incubated at a range of thermal regimes, and the resultant hatchlings raised in large outdoor enclosures. We applied an aromatase inhibitor to half the eggs to override thermal effects on sex determination, thus decoupling sex and incubation temperature. Based on relationships between incubation temperatures, hatching dates, morphology, growth, and survival of hatchlings in their first season, we were able to reject three of the four differential fitness models. First, matching offspring sex to egg size was not plausible because the relationship between egg (offspring) size and fitness was similar in the two sexes. Second, sex differences in optimal incubation temperatures were not evident, because (1) although incubation temperature influenced offspring phenotypes and growth, it did so in similar ways in sons versus daughters, and (2) the relationship between phenotypic traits and fitness was similar in the two sexes, at least during preadult life. We were unable to reject a fourth model, in which TSD enhances offspring fitness by generating seasonal shifts in offspring sex ratio: that is, TSD allows overproduction of daughters (the sex likely to benefit most from early hatching) early in the nesting season. In keeping with this model, hatching early in the season massively enhanced body size at the beginning of the first winter, albeit with a significant decline in probability of survival. Thus, the timing of hatching is likely to influence reproductive success in this short-lived, early maturing species; and this effect may well differ between the sexes.",Partially,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Did not extract data from hormone manipulated lizards. 1497,Warner,"Warner, DA; Shine, R",2008,The Adaptive Significance Of Temperature-Dependent Sex Determination In A Reptile,Nature,451,7178,566-568,10.1038/nature06519,"Understanding the mechanisms that determine an individual's sex remains a primary challenge for evolutionary biology.

Females maintained on a poor-quality diet produced fewer clutches but massively (twofold) larger eggs with lower concentrations of yolk testosterone than did conspecific females given a high-quality diet. Although all eggs were incubated at the same temperature, and yolk steroid hormone levels were not correlated with offspring sex, the nutrient-deprived females produced highly male-biased sex ratios among their offspring.

Moreover, the influence of nest conditions on offspring sex ratios adds another level of complexity for species with environmental sex determination. To elucidate these issues, we need field data on nesting behaviour that incorporate the multiple influences that operate under natural conditions. We radiotracked gravid jacky dragons, Amphibolurus muricatus, in open forest habitats of southeastern Australia to document the lizards' criteria for nest-site choice females selected sites with lower than average canopy cover, resulting in relatively warm nests throughout the prolonged nesting season. Although soil moisture levels decreased over this period and were strongly correlated with mean temperatures, female lizards were able to locate nesting sites that provided consistently moist (and increasingly warm) incubation conditions as the season progressed. Such sites apparently became more difficult to find later in the season, resulting in a higher incidence of test holes prior to nest excavation. Seasonal shifts in diel maximum temperatures also pushed the daily time of digging activity into the evening. Because jacky dragons have temperature-dependent sex determination, the seasonal shift in mean incubation temperatures of natural nests would generate seasonal shifts in offspring sex ratios in a direction likely to enhance maternal fitness.

But why, then, are viviparous reptiles so successful in tropical climates? Viviparity might enhance fitness in the tropics via the same pathway as in the temperate zone, if pregnant female reptiles in the tropics maintain more stable temperatures than are available in nests (Shine's maternal manipulation hypothesis). Alternatively, viviparity might succeed in the tropics for entirely different reasons than apply in the temperate zone. Our data support the maternal manipulation hypothesis. In a laboratory thermal gradient, pregnant death adders (Acanthophis praelongus) from tropical Australia maintained less variable body temperatures (but similar mean temperatures) than did nonpregnant females. Females kept at a diel range of 25-31 degrees C (as selected by pregnant females) gave birth earlier and produced larger offspring (greater body length and head size) than did females kept at 23-33 degrees C (as selected by nonpregnant snakes). Larger body size enhanced offspring recapture rates (presumably reflecting survival rates) in the field. Thus, even in the tropics, reproducing female reptiles manipulate the thermal regimes experienced by their developing embryos in ways that enhance the fitness of their offspring.

Administration of estradiol will counteract the masculinizing effects of a male-producing temperature, resulting in female hatchlings. To address whether temperature and estrogen are biologically equivalent, two experiments were conducted with the red-eared slider turtle, Trachemys scripta. In the first experiment, varying dosages of estrogen were administered at Stage 17 (the middle of the temperature-sensitive window) to eggs maintained at two temperatures, 26-degrees-C (which normally produces all males) and 28.2-degrees-C (which produces mostly males but lies at the threshold of the transition from male- to female-producing temperatures). Results indicate that estrogen and temperature exert a synergistic effect on sex determination. In the second experiment, estrogen was administered at different stages of embryonic development. The results indicate an estrogen-sensitive period ranging from Stage 14 through Stage 21, a period similar to the temperature-sensitive period for this species. The results of these experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that temperature and estradiol act in a common pathway in temperature-dependent sex determination.",Partially,N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Hormone manipulation data excluded.1517,Wibbels,"Wibbels, T; Crews, D",1992,Specificity Of Steroid Hormone-Induced Sex Determination In A Turtle,Journal of Endocrinology,133,1,121-129,10.1677/joe.0.1330121,"The specificity of steroid hormone-induced sex determination was investigated in the red-eared slider, Trachemys scripta, a turtle with temperature-dependent sex determination. All eggs were incubated at either a female-producing temperature (31-degrees-C) or a male-producing temperature (26-degrees-C) and received control or experimental treatments at stage 17-18 of embryonic development. A variety of treatments induced female sex determination at the male-producing temperature. Oestradiol-17-beta, diethylstilboestrol (DES) (an oestrogen agonist) and norethindrone (NET) (a progestin with reputed oestrogenic as well as anti-oestrogenic properties) were the most effective in inducing female sex determination. Other reputed oestrogen antagonists/partial agonists (i.e. tamoxifen, nafoxidine and clomiphene citrate) were also capable of inducing female sex determination, but to a lesser extent. A high dosage of testosterone resulted in the production of some females (7 of 15 hatchlings) whereas dihydrotestosterone had no detectable effect on sex determination. This latter finding suggests that testosterone could be acting via aromatization to oestradiol-17-beta. A few females resulted from eggs that had been treated with aromatase inhibitor, 1,4,6-androstatrien-3,17-dione (ATD) (3 of 97), the antiandrogen hydroxyflutamide (1 of 55) and progesterone (3 of 36), suggesting the possibilities of non-specific effects of these compounds when used in large dosages. Alternatively, metabolites of these compounds may be oestrogenic. Collectively, the results at the male-producing temperature are consistent with the hypothesis that steroid-induced female sex determination is mediated via an oestrogen-specific receptor. With the exception of a single male turtle (produced from an egg treated with 4-androsten-4-ol-3,17-dione (4-OHA)), the various treatments were not able to induce male sex determination at a female-producing temperature. This suggests that either (i) sex determination has little or no sensitivity to steroid hormones at a female-producing temperature, (ii) the effects of steroid hormones are overridden by the effect of the female-producing temperature or (iii) the effects of steroid hormones are similar to the effects of the female-producing temperature and are thus masked. The effects of the treatments on Mullerian duct differentiation and development were also recorded. NET exerted distinct and equivalent effects at both male- and female-producing temperatures, with many of the females exhibiting a hypertrophied cranial portion of the Mullerian ducts but lacking the caudal portion (i.e. Mullerian duct agenesia). A similar effect was shown for the majority of females produced from eggs treated with DES and for one turtle produced from an egg treated with oestradiol-17-beta at the female-producing temperature. Certain dosages of oestradiol-17-beta and oestradiol-3-benzoate resulted in females with full length hypertrophied Mullerian ducts. Tamoxifen, nafoxidine and clomiphene citrate treatments did not stimulate Mullerian duct agenesia, but they did appear to act as oestrogen agonists in blocking Mullerian duct regression in some males. Further, although clomiphene citrate did not stimulate agenesia, it did produce hypertrophic Mullerian ducts in some males and females. The latter result is consistent with the hypothesis that different receptors could be involved in the differentiation versus hypertrophy of the Mullerian ducts.",Partially,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Hormone manipulation and injection controls data excluded.1518,Wibbels,T.

These studies have also suggested that the sensitivity of TSD to exogenous steroids may vary with incubation temperature. The majority of these studies, however, have utilized incubation temperatures producing all males or all females in the control groups, rather than temperatures which produced mixed sex ratios in control groups. The goals of the current study were to examine the effects of steroids on sex determination in a turtle (Trachemys scripta) at temperatures which produced mixed sex ratios in the control groups. Collectively, the results of single-treatment experiments indicate that at incubation temperatures producing mixed sex ratios in control groups, (1) estradiol-17 beta, tamoxifen, norethindrone, and testosterone all showed a similar ''type'' of effect (i.e., feminizing) as in previous studies utilizing male-producing temperatures, (2) sex determination has significantly increased sensitivity to estradiol-17 beta in comparison to its effect at temperatures producing all males, and (3) sex determination is sensitive to the masculinizing effects of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) (in previous studies utilizing female-producing temperature DHT did not affect sex determination). Last, a set of double-treatment experiments was performed in which eggs received both estradiol-17 beta and DHT treatments. No significant increases in the production of males were detected. Significant increases in the production of females were detected, but only in the groups receiving the highest dosage of estradiol-17 beta (1.0 mu g). This contrasts the results of the single-treatment experiments in which lower dosages of estradiol-17 beta were effective (0.1 and 0.01 mu g), thus suggesting that DHT in some way decreases the effectiveness of estradiol-17 beta. Further, a number of hatchlings in the double-treatment experiments developed intersex gonads (i.e., the gonads had well-developed medullary and cortical regions), suggesting that cortical and medullary development of the gonads are not mutually exclusive.

At those developmental stages, groups of eggs were either (1) treated with a control solution (95% ethanol) and placed back at the male-producing temperature, (2) treated with 10 mug of estradiol-17beta and placed back at the male-producing temperature, or (3) shifted to a female-producing temperature (31-degrees-C). Additionally, a control group of freshly laid eggs was continually incubated at 31-degrees-C throughout embryonic development. To examine morphological events occurring after the treatments, a subset of embryos from each group was examined at the time of the treatment and at 1-2 stage intervals following the treatments.

The estimated pivotal temperature (approximately 30.0-degrees-C) is higher than those reported for other species of Graptemys in North America; however, the interspecific variations in pivotal temperature are small (approximately 0.5-1.0-degrees-C).

In addition, temperature appears to exert a graded effect on the regression of the oviducts in males.

Because of this relationship between nest temperature and hatchling outcomes, global warming presents an immediate threat to many sea turtle nesting beaches throughout the world. Even small rises in nest temperatures may skew sex ratios and, raise egg mortality and influence hatchling phenotypes adversely, impacting on hatchling recruitment and ultimately species survival at some rookeries. The development of adaptive management practices capable of minimizing the effects of increasing global temperature on nest temperatures is thus a priority for animals exhibiting temperature-dependent sex-determination, such as sea turtles. Here, the relationship between solar radiation exposure and nest temperatures at the Mon Repos turtle rookery, south east Queensland, Australia was explored and the relationship between nest temperature and hatchling attributes examined. Shading decreased nest temperature, and higher nest temperatures were associated with smaller sized hatchlings that had decreased locomotion performance. The use of shading to minimize nest temperature is a management strategy that may be used to mitigate detrimental effects of increased global temperatures at some rookeries. Here, we explored the viability of natural shading options, such as the planting of trees behind nesting beaches, for combating the adverse effect of increased nest temperature caused by increased air temperatures.

An appealing approach to estimate hatchling sex ratios is to measure sand temperatures at nest depth and deduce hatchling sex ratios from a beforehand-established relationship of hatchling sex ratio and sand temperature. Such estimates will only be accurate though if metabolic heat produced by the embryos is considered. Judging whether metabolic heating has a potential effect on hatchling sex ratios without actually measuring temperature within clutches would greatly facilitate monitoring protocols. We tested for a relationship between the amount of metabolic heating and the number of developed embryos as well as Clutch size in the largest known loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta) population of the Mediterranean on Zakynthos (Greece). Temperatures were measured within 20 nests as well as at a reference site in the sand at nest depth. Metabolic heating was detected, but only during the last third of the incubation period did nests heat up considerably (1.6 degrees C on average) above the temperature of the Surrounding sand. During the middle third of incubation, when sex is determined, the amount of metabolic heating was negligible. The amount of metabolic heating during the last third of the incubation duration was significantly correlated to the number of offspring developed to at least about 75% of incubation duration. This factor explained nearly 50% of variation in metabolic heating. Metabolic heating was also significantly correlated to clutch size. Given that clutch size within the Mediterranean is largest in Zakynthos loggerheads, we conclude that metabolic heating can be ignored in the estimate of hatchling sex ratios in Mediterranean loggerhead populations. These results thus provide the basis for a feasible monitoring of hatchling sex ratios in the loggerhead sea turtle in the Mediterranean. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The warmer temperatures resulted in shorter gestation periods and a higher ratio of male: female births; however, gestation temperature did not affect the neonates' body mass or snout-vent length (SVL).

We predicted the sex of a hatchling by examining its genitalia within the cloaca. Our predictions were verified by inspecting the gonads macroscopically and histologically. The male clitero-penis typically is red, round, and large (mean length = 4.1 mm) in comparison with the female organ (mean length = 2.8 mm), which is white and smaller.

Ectotherms are taxa considered highly sensitive to rapid climate warming. This is because body temperature profoundly governs their performance, fitness and life history. Yet, while several modelling approaches currently predict thermal effects on some aspects of life history and demography, they do not consider how temperature simultaneously affects developmental success and offspring phenotypic performance, two additional key attributes that are needed to comprehensively understand species responses to climate warming. 2. Here, we developed a stepwise, individual-level modelling approach linking biophysical and developmental models with empirically derived performance functions to predict the effects of temperature-induced changes to offspring viability, phenotype and performance, using green sea turtle hatchlings as an ectotherm model. Climate warming is expected to particularly threaten sea turtles, as their life-history traits may preclude them from rapid adaptation. 3. Under conservative and extreme warming, our model predicted large effects on performance attributes key to dispersal, as well as a reduction in offspring viability. Forecast sand temperatures produced smaller, weaker hatchlings, which were up to 40% slower than at present, albeit with increased energy stores.

Further, there is a dose-response relationship but no apparent synergism between exogenous dihydrotestosterone and incubation temperature.

Administration of exogenous estradiol and its agonists to eggs incubating at a male-producing temperature can overcome the effect of temperature and result in all-female offspring. Exogenous testosterone will also result in some female hatchlings if administered to eggs incubated at a male-producing temperature, an effect due to the aromatization of testosterone to estradiol. This study demonstrates that in the red-eared slider, androstenedione, the precursor to both testosterone and estradiol, has a similar effect. In addition, both testosterone and androstenedione synergize with incubation temperature to exert a greater effect at intermediate incubation temperatures that normally produce mixed sex ratios, indicating that as with estradiol, androstenedione and testosterone are involved in the final common pathway of sex determination in this species.

This study demonstrates that, in the red-eared slider, there is a complex interaction between incubation temperature, different estrogens, and the dosage effect of each hormone. There are changes in potency of different estrogens with incubation temperature such that estriol is more potent than estrone and estradiol-17 beta at 26 degrees (an all-male producing incubation temperature), estrone and estriol are equipotent to each other and more potent than estradiol-17 beta at 28.8 degrees (an incubation temperature that produced a male-biased sex ratio), and estradiol-17 beta is more potent than estrone and estriol at 29 degrees (an incubation temperature that produced equal numbers of males and females). These changes may be due to differences in synergism between the hormones and incubation temperature. Estriol treatment also resulted in cranially hypertrophied oviducts at all incubation temperatures in a dose-dependent manner, whereas animals treated with estradiol-17 beta and estrone had normal oviducts.

Empirical evidence, however, is lacking. In this paper, we provide such evidence from a study of clinal variation in four sex-determining traits (maternal nesting behaviour, pivotal temperatures, nesting phenology, and nest depth) in Physignathus lesueurii, a wide-ranging ESD lizard inhabiting eastern Australia. Despite marked differences in air and soil temperatures across our five study sites spanning 19 degrees latitude and 1200 m in elevation, nest temperatures did not differ significantly among sites. Lizards compensated for climatic differences chiefly by selecting more open nest sites with higher incident radiation at cooler sites. Clinal variation in the onset of nesting also compensated for climatic differences, but to a lesser extent. There was no evidence of compensation through pivotal temperatures or nest depth. More broadly, our results extend to the egg stage the life history prediction that behaviour is the chief compensatory mechanism for climatic differences experienced by species spanning environmental extremes. Furthermore, our study was unique in revealing that nest site choice influenced mainly the daily range in nest temperatures, rather than mean temperatures, in a shallow-nesting reptile. Finally, indirect evidence suggests that the cue used by nesting lizards was radiation or temperature (through basking or assessing substrate temperatures), not visual detection of canopy openness. We conclude that maternal nesting behaviour and nesting phenology are traits subject to sex ratio selection in P. lesueurii, and thus, must be considered among the repertoire of ESD species for responding to climate change.",Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1570,Du,"W.-G.

We incubated eggs of the Chinese three-keeled pond turtle (Chinemys reevesii) at 6 constant temperatures (24, 26, 28, 30, 32 and 34æÁC) to test for the effects of embryonic thermal environment on incubation duration, hatching success, hatchling size and mass, sex ratio and post-hatching growth. Incubation duration (ID) decreased nonlinearly as the temperature (T) increased, and could be estimated by the equation: IDæ=æ42.74æ_æexp (4.30æ/æ(Tæ_æ17.28). Eggs incubated at 32æÁC and 34æÁC had lower hatching success than those at 24æÁC, 26æÁC and 28æÁC.

In contrast, there was no difference in growth rate either within females or within males from different temperatures. The dichotomy of growth rate between turtles from high vs low temperatures are thus largely attributed to between-sex difference rather than temperature effects. Taken together, our results indicate that the temperatures ranging from 28 to 30æÁC are most suitable for egg incubation inæC. reevesii, because of the high hatchability and post-hatching survival, and the fastest growth of hatchlings in these thermal regimes.

However, incubation at low temperatures increases the total number of heart beats required to complete embryogenesis, because the embryo spends much of its time at temperatures that require maintenance functions but that do not allow embryonic growth or differentiation. Thus, cool-incubated embryos allocate additional metabolic effort to maintenance costs. Under warm conditions, total number of heart beats thus predicts incubation period in non-avian reptiles as well as in birds (the total number of heart beats are also similar); however, under the colder nest conditions often experienced by non-avian reptiles, maintenance costs add significantly to total embryonic metabolic expenditure.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Not applicable; Measured embryo heart rates1573,Du,"Du, WG; Wang, L; Shen, JW",2010,Optimal Temperatures For Egg Incubation In Two Geoemydid Turtles: Ocadia Sinensis And Mauremys Mutica,Aquaculture,305,1-Apr,138-142,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.03.032,"Egg incubation is critical for artificial reproduction of turtles, but how incubation conditions affect embryos and resultant hatchlings remains unknown in many species.

Incubation period of O. sinensis eggs was shorter than that of M. mutica eggs. In both species, hatching success was high in the temperature range of 26-30 degrees C, and hatchlings were mainly males if incubated at low temperatures and females at high temperatures. The pivotal temperature for sex determination fell into the range of 28-30 degrees C for O. sinensis and 26-28 degrees C for M. mutica. Incubation temperature profoundly affected post-hatching growth in M. mutica, but not in O. sinensis. Hatchling M. mutica from 24 and 26 degrees C grew faster than those from 28 and 30 degrees C. Therefore, temperatures around 26 or 28 degrees C would be optimal incubation temperatures for M. mutica or O. sinensis to improve hatching success and post-hatching growth, and to yield offspring with a balanced sex ratio.

Sex is fully determined at the time of hatching and irreversible thereafter. Constant temperature laboratory experiments revealed that the sex of Alligator miuissippiensis is determined by the temperature of egg incubation, 30ÁC or below producing females, and 34ÁC or above, males. Experiments in which eggs were shifted from female-producing temperatures to male-producing temperatures and vice versa at weekly intervals during incubation demonstrated that the temperature-sensitive period for sex determination is around 20 and 35 days after egg laying. In the wild, temperature probes were placed in alligator nests constructed in three different habitats: wet marsh, dry marsh and levee (elevated firm ground). The position of the eggs in the nests were mapped at 60 days incubation and the sex of the enclosed hatchlings correlated with the nest temperatures at that site. Levee nests were hot (34ÁC) and hatched approximately 100% males. Wet marsh nests were cool (30ÁC) and hatched approximately 100% females. Dry marsh nests had an intermediate temperature profile, the hottest location (34ÁC) being the top centre of the nest. Males developed from eggs in this location and females from eggs around the periphery and base of the nest. The sex ratio in dry marsh nests was five females to one male. The natural sex ratio at hatching was determined for a large area of representative habitat for four consecutive years and averaged five (±0.7) females to one male. Females hatched from eggs incubated at 30ÁC weighed more than males hatched from eggs incubated at 34ÁC because the former contained more absorbed abdominal yolk. These extra energy reserves enable females to grow faster and become larger than males in the early years of life.

Metabolic rate of embryos is temperature dependent, with oxygen consumption increasing exponentially as a function of temperature. Because metabolic rate is more temperature sensitive than diffusion, developmental processes are predicted to be oxygen-limited at high temperatures. We tested the hypothesis that the amount of development lizard embryos achieve in the oviduct is dependent upon both temperature and oxygen availability. We evaluated the effect of temperature (23, 33 degrees C) and oxygen concentration (9%, 15%, 21% O-2) on survival and development of embryos of the oviparous skink Scincella lateralis. We predicted that incubation at 33 degrees C under hypoxic conditions would result in higher embryo mortality due to mismatch between embryo oxygen demand and oxygen supply compared to eggs incubated at 23 degrees C under hypoxic conditions. Embryo mortality was highest at 33 degrees C/9% O-2 (86%) compared to 23 degrees C/9% O-2 (14%), however, mortality did not differ among any other oxygen-temperature treatment combination. Both temperature and oxygen affected differentiation, but the interaction between temperature and oxygen was not significant. Embryo growth in mass and hatchling mass were affected by oxygen concentration independent of temperature treatment. Differing responses of growth and differentiation to temperature and oxygen treatments suggests that somatic growth may be more sensitive to oxygen availability than differentiation. Results indicate that embryo mortality can occur both via the direct effect of high temperature on cellular function as well as indirectly through thermally induced oxygen diffusion limitation. J.

In ectothermic taxa, offspring phenotypes are often sensitive to developmental temperatures. If the effectiveness of alternative anti-predator responses depends on thermally sensitive traits, then the temperatures experienced during embryonic life should also affect how offspring respond to an approaching predator. We incubated 16 clutches of Swedish grass snakes (Natrix natrix) at a range of developmental temperatures, and scored body size, colour pattern, locomotor performance and anti-predator responses of 213 hatchlings from those clutches. A hatchling snake's size and locomotor abilities were affected by its clutch of origin, its developmental temperature, and by an interaction between these two factors. Anti-predator tactics were strongly linked to locomotor ability, such that slower snakes tended to rely upon aggressive displays rather than flight. Incubation temperatures that generated slow (and thus aggressive) snakes also modified the colour of the snake's nuchal spot. Temperatures in the low to medium range generated mostly cream, white and orange spots, whereas medium to high temperatures generated more yellow spots. Incubation effects, and gene X environment interactions, thus may generate complex correlations between morphology, locomotor ability, and anti-predator tactics. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The sex, size, growth, survival, emergence behaviour, morphotype, pigmentation, and locomotor performance of offspring were measured up to 3 months of age. Most offspring characteristics (e.g. sex) were not influenced by maternal basking regime. However, maternal pregnancy success was lower, and female offspring were slower growing, and thus smaller, when from regimes mimicking high cloud cover, suggesting potential long-term influences on population dynamics.

Egg incubation treatments began at 29.5 degrees C and progressively increased in temperature throughout incubation, up to maxima of 31, 32, 33, 34 and 35 degrees C.

We incubated red-eared slider turtle embryos at three different constant temperatures (T(inc); 26.5, 28.5, 30.5ÁC), then divided the resulting hatchlings between two water temperatures (T(water); 25, 30ÁC). We calculated growth rates to assess the short- and long-term effects of thermal experience on this metabolically costly process. We also measured resting metabolic rate (RMR) at three body temperatures (T(body;) 26.5, 28.5, 30.5ÁC) shortly after hatching and 6 months posthatching to characterize the degree and persistence of acclimation to T(inc) and T(water) . Hatchling RMRs were affected by T(body) and T(inc) , and fit a pattern consistent with positive but incomplete metabolic compensation to T(inc) . Average growth rates over the first 11 weeks posthatching were strongly affected by T(water) but only marginally influenced by T(inc) , and only at T(water) = 30ÁC. Six-month RMRs exhibited strong acclimation to T(water) consistent with positive metabolic compensation. However, within each T(water) treatment, RMR fit patterns indicative of inverse metabolic compensation to T(inc) , opposite of the pattern observed in hatchlings. Average growth rates calculated over 6 months continued to show a strong effect of T(water) , and the previously weak effect of T(inc) observed within the 30ÁC T(water) treatment became more pronounced.

An electronic thermometer in conjunction with a thermostat located in sand beneath a heater plate was used to obtain the desired temperature in the placed eggs, as compared to previous methods of controlling global temperature within the interior of a chamber. To test the new incubator, Lepidochelys olivacea eggs were incubated under different thermal conditions in order to identify the temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD) period more precisely. Four incubation experiments were designed to test the performance of the incubator where the temperature was lowered from 32 to 28 degrees C during 60 h and then reestablished at 32 degrees C until hatching occurred. A significant mean hatching success rate of 89.6% was obtained for all the experiments. The main result from these preliminary findings was that the sex determination period to produce males was reduced from 15 (days 15-30) to eight days (days 19-27).

Two-month-old caiman were raised at 2 different temperatures (29 and 33 degrees C) for 100 d.

Some PCB congeners are without effect whereas others synergize to alter sex determination in this species. Application of two potent PCB congeners alter the physiological processes of gonad development normally dictated by the male-producing temperature (MPT), resulting sex ratios significantly biased toward female hatchlings. Of these PCB-induced females, oviduct formation is prominently distorted regardless of ovary development. Further, gonadal expression of ovarian markers, aromatase, FoxL2, and Rspo1, is activated whereas testicular markers, Dmrt1 and Sox9, are suppressed compared with typical expression patterns observed at MPT. DNA methylation profiles of the aromatase promoter in PCB-treated gonads do not follow the typical methylation pattern observed in embryos incubating at female-producing temperature. Rather, the MPT-typical methylation profiles is retained despite the induced ovarian formation.

In organisms with temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD), targets of sex-ratio selection include the thermal sensitivity of the sex-determining pathway (hereafter, sex determination threshold) and nest-site choice. However, offspring sex may be canalized for nests located in thermally extreme environments; thus, genetic variance for the sex determination threshold is not expressed and is invisible to direct selection. The concept of 'effective heritability' accounts for this dependence and provides a more realistic prediction of the expected evolutionary response to selection in the wild. Past estimates of effective heritability of the sex determination threshold, which were derived from laboratory data, suggested that the potential for the sex determination threshold to evolve in the wild was extremely low. We re-evaluated original estimates of this parameter by analysing field-collected measures of nest temperatures, vegetation cover and clutch sex ratios from nests in a population of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta). We coupled these data with measurements of broad-sense heritability of the sex determination threshold in C. picta, using an experiment that splits clutches of eggs between a constant temperature (i.e. typical laboratory incubation) and a daily fluctuating temperature (i.e. similar to natural nests) with the same mean. We found that (i) the effective heritability of the sex determination threshold appears to have been historically underestimated and the effective heritability of nest-site choice has been overestimated and (ii) significant family-by-incubation treatment interaction exists for sex for C. picta between constant- and fluctuating-temperature regimes.

The finding that exogenous estradiol (E2) overcomes the effect of male-promoting temperature led to the idea that temperature may regulate estrogen concentration in the gonad during TSP. Since interspecific variations in TSP and in the effect of exogenous E2 exist, we undertook a study in the olive ridley Lepidochelys olivacea. Four parameters were correlated: the TSP (time dimension), the thermosensitive stages (rate of development), gonad development (histological aspect), and the estradiol response. Two kinds of experiments were performed: (1) Eggs were shifted once, at different stages of development, from a male-promoting temperature to a female-temperature (or vice versa) for the remainder of development. (2) Eggs at male-promoting temperature were treated once with 6 or 12 mu g of estradiol (E2) at various times of incubation. Sex ratio was established around hatching in each experimental series. We found that the temporal dimension of the TSP was around 7 days (Days 20-27 of incubation) at a male-promoting or a female-promoting temperature. The rate of development of the whole embryo and gonadal growth was faster at female-promoting temperature than at male-promoting temperature. Formation of the genital ridge began at stage 21-22 and histological differentiation of the gonads occurred around stage 26-27. Although these stages coincided with the TSP, at male-promoting temperature the thermosensitive stages occurred earlier (from stages 20-21 to stages 23-24) than at female-promoting temperature (from stages 23-24 to stages 26-27). Thus, at male promoting-temperature, sex was determined in embryos with incipient or undifferentiated gonads. In contrast, E2 treatment continued to feminize the gonads of embryos at a male-promoting temperature beyond the TSP up to stage 25-26, but the E2-induced ovaries were significantly smaller than temperature-induced ovaries. It is suggested that the doses of E2 used were higher than the concentration of endogenous E2 required for normal sex determination. The lack of correlation between sex determination and gonad differentiation suggests that irreversible molecular processes underlying sex determination occur earlier at male-than at female-promoting temperature. Results suggest that the male sex may be the default state and that the female condition must be imposed upon it.

Eggs hatch normally between 28Á and 38ÁC at environmental water potentials between 50 and 1500 kPa. Predictions were derived for the timing and placement of egg clutches based on soil water potential and temperature profiles measures in the field and on the results of laboratory incubation experiments. The results suggest that egg burrows should be located at depths >22 cm in washes or possibly in sparsely vegetated areas away from creosote bushes. The biogeography of desert iguanas within the United States is discussed in relation to soil environments and tolerances of eggs. The physical factors affecting incubation may limit the geographical range of desert iguanas.,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1628,Noble,"NOBLE, RC; DEEMING, DC; FERGUSON, MWJ; MCCARTNEY, R",1989,The Effects Of Incubation-Temperature On The Lipid Metabolism Of Embryos Of Alligator Mississippiensis,Journal of Comparative Physiology B,159,2,183-193,https://link-springer-com.simsrad.net.ocs.mq.edu.au/article/10.1007/BF00691739,"Eggs of Alligator mississippiensisæwere incubated at 30 ÁC and 33 ÁC throughout incubation up to hatching.

Freshwater turtles are considered to be susceptible species since their development is dependent on incubation temperature. In Thailand, although several species of freshwater turtle are present, the extent of their susceptibility to temperature change is unknown due to the lack of information on their developmental patterns. This research, therefore, is aimed at examining the effects of temperature on somatic development in Malayemys macrocephala, a native species and the most common freshwater turtle in Thailand. Turtle eggs were collected from rice fields in the central part of Thailand during December 2011 to February 2012 inclusive.

At a high temperature (32 degrees C), turtle embryos showed a significantly faster growth rate than at the intermediate and low temperatures (29 degrees C and 26 degrees C), but had a significantly (over 3.3-fold) higher incidence of developmental abnormalities (especially deformed bodies) than at the lower temperatures.

The implication of steroid sex hormones as the proximate trigger for sex determination opens the possibility that endocrine-disrupting contaminants may also influence the outcome of sexual differentiation. In this study we investigate the potential effects of DDE (a common DDT metabolite) on sexual differentiation of Chelonia mydas (green sea turtle). Four clutches of eggs collected from Heron Island, Queensland, Australia: were treated with DDE at the beginning of the thermosensitive period for sexual determination. An incubation temperature of 28 degrees C or less produces male hatchlings in this species, whereas 30 degrees C or more produces female hatchlings. Dosed eggs were consequently incubated at two temperatures (27.6 degrees C and 30.4 degrees C) on the upper and lower boundaries of the sex determination threshold for this species. DDE, ranging from 3.3 to 66.5 mu g, was dissolved in 5, 10, and 25 mu l ethanol and applied to eggshells above the embryo. Less than 2.5 ng/g DDE was present in eggs prior to dosing. Approximately 34% of the applied DDE was absorbed in the eggs, jut only approximately 8% of applied DDE was found in embryos. Thus, treated eggs, corrected, for background DDE, had up to 543 ng/g DDE. The sex ratio at these doses did not differ from what would be expected on consideration of temperature alone. Incubation time, hatching success, incidence of body deformities, hatching size, and weight were also within the limits of healthy developed hatchlings.

Pre-ovipositional arrest is an obligate part of the life cycle and occurs universally in turtle embryos, commencing while eggs are in the oviduct and persisting until after oviposition. Pre-ovipositional arrest allows turtle mothers the flexibility to choose an optimum time to nest and provides embryos some capacity to respond to varying environmental conditions immediately after eggs are laid. Following oviposition, turtle embryos are known to be significantly affected by incubation conditions and specifically, temperature has a profound influence on developmental rate and success of embryos. We conducted a comparative investigation of how temperature influences (1) the duration of pre-ovipositional arrest after eggs are laid, (2) the number of embryos that fail to recommence development and (3) hatching success, using eggs of the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), and three species of freshwater turtle; the western oblong turtle (Chelodina oblonga), the eastern longneck turtle (Chelodina longicollis), and the Murray River turtle (Emydura macquarii). We incubated arrested eggs of each species at three different temperatures (low, medium, high) and monitored embryonic development immediately after oviposition and throughout incubation. Interspecific variation was evident in the effects that temperature had on pre-ovipositional arrest, subsequent embryonic development and hatching success. A major finding of this study was that, with the exception ofæE. macquarii, there was no significant difference in the time to white spot development (the first external visible sign of embryological development following arrest) between temperature treatments, suggesting that the resumption of development and the breaking of pre-ovipositional arrest after eggs are laid are independent of temperature. Furthermore, although the number ofæC. mydasæeggs to successfully recommence development after oviposition was consistently high (~æ97_100%) across the three temperature treatments, a significant proportion ofæC. oblongaæandæE. macquariiæeggs failed to resume development. In both the low and high temperature treatments the rate ofæC. oblongaæembryo mortality was 95% and 60%, respectively, and foræE. macquariiæit was 53% and 24% respectively.

The temperature sensitive period for sex determination has been defined by shifting eggs between female-and male-producing temperatures in a few species. This phase spans 20-356 of embryogenesis in most species, which makes it difficult to define the mechanisms that transduce temperature into a signal for ovarian versus testicular development. We present an extensive set of studies that define a brief period when high temperature specifies, and then determines, ovarian fate in a northern population of snapping turtles, Chelydra serpentine. We shifted embryos from male to female temperatures, or vice versa, at various stages of development. Gonads in embryos incubated at female temperatures commit to ovarian fate earlier (by stage 18) than gonads in embryos incubated at male temperatures commit to testicular fate (by stages 19-21). In double shift studies, embryos were incubated at a female temperature, exposed to a male temperature for set Limes, and shifted back to the original temperature, or vice versa. The Lime required to induce ovarian development ( <= 6 days at female temperatures) was much shorter than the time required to induce testicular formation ( > 20 days at male temperatures). Differentiation of the gonads at the histological level occurred after the sex-determining period. Nevertheless, we found that a change in temperature rapidly (within 24 h) influenced expression and splicing of WT1 mRNA: the absolute abundance of WT1 mRNA, the relative abundance of +KTS versus - KTS isoforms, as well as the ratio of +KTS:-KTS isoforms was higher in gonads at a male versus a female temperature. In conclusion, ovarian fate is more readily determined than testicular fate in snapping turtle embryos. The short sex-determining period in this species (6-8% of embryogenesis) will facilitate studies of molecular mechanisms for specification and determination of gonad fate by temperature.

Injection of contaminants directly into eggs is one route of experimental contaminant exposure that permits controlled doses and potential reliable replication. This technique, however, has been used in the past with little success in reptiles. The objective of the present study was to evaluate egg injection as a means of mimicking maternal transfer of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to snapping turtle eggs. Eggs from several clutches were injected with a PCB solution and incubated at several temperatures and moisture levels to measure interactive effects of injection, environmental condition, and contaminant load on hatching success. The injection technique allowed for application of consistent and specific doses among replicates. Overall hatching success in this study was 61% and was as high as 71% within specific treatments.

We incubated eggs of ail agamid lizard (Amphibolurus muricatus) and a scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi), two species with TSD.

Fadrozole application sex-reversed the resultant hatchlings if applied from the time of oviposition until at least 60% of the way through incubation. In all of the TSD lizard species studied so far, offspring sex is determined either while the eggs are held inside the mother's body or soon after oviposition, providing substantial maternal control over incubation temperatures at this critical period. Hence, the hypothesis that TSD evolves because it enables offspring sex to be matched to conditions that are unpredictable at the time of laying is less likely to apply to squamates than to turtles, sphenodontians, and (especially) crocodiles, in which the period of sexual lability is delayed until long after oviposition.",N,N,N,N,Y,Y,N,N,N,Hormone manipulation study; Did not incubate eggs at multiple temps1644,Sim,"Sim, EL; Booth, DT; Limpus, CJ",2014,"Non-Modal Scute Patterns, Morphology, And Locomotor Performance Of Loggerhead (Caretta Caretta) And Flatback (Natator Depressus) Turtle Hatchlings",Copeia,2014,1,63-69,10.1643/CP-13-041,"Non-modal scute patterns are observed more frequently in hatchlings than in adult sea turtles, which suggests greater survival of hatchlings with the modal scute pattern.

Since C latirostris is a species with temperature dependent sex determination, eggs were incubated at male (33 degrees C) or female (30 degrees C) producing temperatures and the effect of EDC was evaluated. Neonatal ovaries exhibited germ cells mainly located in clusters evidencing proliferative activity and type I to III follicles. Juvenile ovaries exhibited germ cells and advanced stages of pre-vitellogenic follicles. Prenatal exposure to the highest doses of E(2) (1.4 ppm) or BPA (140 ppm) overrode male temperature effect on sex determination. Neonatal females produced by sex reversion lacked type III follicles, while females prenatally exposed to the lowest doses of E(2) (0.014 ppm) and BPA (1.4 ppm) or ATZ (0.2 ppm) showed an increase in type III follicles. Juvenile caiman prenatally exposed to E(2) or BPA showed an augmented incidence of multioocyte follicles. Neonatal female caiman exposed in ovum to E(2) or BPA had higher estrogen serum levels whereas exposure to E(2), BPA, ATZ and END decreased T levels. Present data demonstrates that exposure to EDC during gonadal organogenesis alters follicular dynamics and steroid levels later in life. These effects might have an impact on caiman fertility.

The sex ratios, male/(male+female), were 0.07 at  4ñC, 0.75 at 28ÁC and 0.24 at 32ÁC. The disparities of the sex ratio from 1/2 were statistically significant and differences in the sex ratio with various incubation temperatures were also significant. These sex ratios can probably be best interpreted by a temperature-Dependent sex determination.

Several studies have examined the ability of estradiol to produce female hatchlings incubated at a male-producing temperature. The results of these experiments support the idea that estradiol could be used as a powerful tool in the conservation of endangered species with TSD by manipulating hatchling sex ratios. However, these experiments have concentrated on the mechanism of determination. This experiment was designed to test the efficacy of various dosages of estradiol applied at two different stages to after the hatchling sex ratio as well as determining the potential use of such manipulation for conservation efforts by monitoring egg mortality and hatchling growth. The leopard gecko (Eublepharis macularius) exhibits TSD and reaches reproductive maturity in less than one year, making it an excellent model for evaluating the long-term effects of estradiol. The results demonstrate that estradiol has a dose-dependent effect on the hatchling sex ratio while only high dosages applied at the later stage of development showed increased mortality. Estrogen-determined females grew at the same rate as temperature-determined females and have produced viable hatchlings. Estradiol treatment of eggs from endangered species may provide a method of insuring female offspring when the TSD pattern is unknown or equipment for controlled incubation is unavailable.

The feminizing effects of exposure to estradiol and the masculinizing effects of aromatase inhibition during development are well established in a broad range of vertebrate taxa, but paradoxical findings are occasionally reported. Four independent experiments were conducted on two turtle species with temperature-dependent sex determination (Chrysemys picta and Chelydra serpentine) to quantify the effects of egg incubation temperature, estradiol, and an aromatase inhibitor on offspring sex ratios. As expected, the warmer incubation temperatures induced female development and the cooler temperatures produced primarily males. However, application of an aromatase inhibitor had no effect on offspring sex ratios, and exogenous applications of estradiol to eggs produced male offspring across all incubation temperatures. These unexpected results were remarkably consistent across all four experiments and both study species. Elevated concentrations of estradiol could interact with androgen receptors or inhibit aromatase expression, which might result in relatively high testosterone concentrations that lead to testis development. These findings add to a short list of studies that report paradoxical effects of steroid hormones, which addresses the need for a more comprehensive understanding of the role of sex steroids in sexual development.

All viable eggs gained mass during incubation due to absorption of water, and both thermal and hydric environments affected water exchanges between eggs and their surroundings, thereby affecting the hydric conditions inside the egg. Eggs incubated at 24_ gained more mass than did eggs at 30_ but at the same substrate water potential; eggs incubated in wetter substrates (0 kPa) gained more mass than did eggs in drier substrates ( - 500 kPa) but at the same temperature.

Substrate moisture significantly affected size (SVL), wet mass and carcass dry mass of hatchlings, with those incubated in wetter substrates being larger in SVL, wet body mass and carcass dry mass than those in drier substrates. Variation in hatchling wet body mass among treatments stemmed mainly from variation in water contents, because there were no significant differences in total dry mass among hatchlings from different incubation conditions designed in this study. More yolk remained unutilized at hatching when eggs were incubated at 30_. Hatchlings incubated at 30_ contained more ash than did those incubated at 24_, largely because they contained more ash in the residual yolk.

At 26 degrees C, the duration of incubation was shorter in the high-latitude population than in the low-latitude population. However, this pattern was reversed at 30 degrees C. As the incubation temperature increased, hatching success increased in the low-latitude population but slightly decreased in the high-latitude population. Hatchlings incubated at 30 degrees C were larger and righted themselves more rapidly than those incubated at 26 degrees C in the low-latitude population. In contrast, hatchling traits were not influenced by incubation temperature in the high-latitude population. Overall, 30 degrees C was a suitable developmental temperature for embryos from the low-latitude population, whereas 26 and 28 degrees C were suitable for those from the high-latitude population. This interpopulation difference in suitable developmental temperatures is consistent with the difference in the thermal environment of the two localities.

The results demonstrated the lethality of the continuous regimes and of the warm temporary regime, no matter if given at early (5 days) or late (15 days) stages of development. Temporary cold stress also resulted in lethality, but only if given in the early stage; later, in fact, it resulted in an abnormal development, with marked alterations in the encephalic vesicles, in the eyes and the trunk organs. By in situ hybridization, it was demonstrated that these alterations were often correlated with changes in HSP70 expression. In conclusion, our data indicate that Podarcis embryos have a limited potential to tolerate thermal changes, especially warm ones.

In natural nests, maximum daily air temperature influenced mean and maximum daily nest temperatures, implying that nest temperatures will increase under climate warming. To determine whether hotter nests influence hatchling phenotypes, we incubated eggs under two fluctuating temperature regimes to mimic current cold' nests (mean=23.2 degrees C, range 10-33 degrees C) and future hot' nests (27.0 degrees C, 14-37 degrees C). Hot' incubation temperatures produced smaller hatchlings than did cold temperature incubation. We released individually marked hatchlings into the wild in 2014 and 2015, and monitored their survival over 10months. In 2014 and 2015, hot-incubated hatchlings had higher annual mortality (99%, 97%) than cold-incubated (11%, 58%) or wild-born hatchlings (78%, 22%). To determine future trajectories of velvet gecko populations under climate warming, we ran population viability analyses in Vortex and varied annual rates of hatchling mortality within the range 78- 96%. Hatchling mortality strongly influenced the probability of extinction and the mean time to extinction. When hatchling mortality was >86%, populations had a higher probability of extinction (PE: range 0.52- 1.0) with mean times to extinction of 18-44years. Whether future changes in hatchling survival translate into reduced population viability will depend on the ability of females to modify their nest-site choices.

The presence of heritable variation in the expression of key thermotolerance genes is necessary for sea turtles to adapt at a molecular level to warming incubation environments.",N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y,"Expression of heat shock protein genes measured in embyros; Heritable variance reported, but not differences among treatments"1672,Dormer,"Dormer, J; Old, JM; Van Dyke, JU; Spencer, RJ",2016,Incubation Temperature Affects Development Order Of Morphological Features And Staging Criteria In Turtle Embryos,Journal of Zoology,299,4,284-294,10.1111/jzo.12346,"Embryonic development is strongly affected by incubation temperature in most animals, and the effects of incubation temperature continue after partition. However, relatively little is known about the effects of incubation temperature on the development of morphological features in reptiles. As a result, whether developmental rates of different traits change uniquely in response to incubation temperature remains unknown. In this study, we compared embryonic development of an Australian turtle incubated at different temperatures. We examined 43 internal and external morphological features of embryos at each week of development and compared presence and absence of each feature within and across weeks and temperature treatments, using a multivariate statistical approach. We identified morphological features that develop at different rates in turtle embryos incubated at different temperatures. Embryos incubated at 30 degrees C hatched 3weeks earlier, grew to hatchling size faster, and developed advanced morphological features earlier than those incubated at 26 degrees C. Furthermore, embryonic features that appear late in development appeared progressively earlier in embryos incubated at 30 degrees C. Embryos incubated at 26 degrees C also retained some early embryonic features for longer periods of time during development, especially from weeks 2-4. Despite temperature effects, some traits appeared at the same week of development in embryos from both treatments, including a clearly distinguishable carapace and distinct gut villi at week 3. Variation in appearance and retention of features means that not all external features consistently appear in the same order, depending on incubation temperature. From a practical perspective, cool- and warm-incubated embryos may exhibit different sets of embryological features, which may not be captured by previously published embryological staging guides.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,NA1673,Monasterio,"Monasterio, C; Verdu-Ricoy, J; Salvador, A; Diaz, JA",2016,Living At The Edge: Lower Success Of Eggs And Hatchlings At Lower Elevation May Shape Range Limits In An Alpine Lizard,Biological Journal of the Linnean Society,118,4,829-841,10.1111/bij.12766,"Studies on range limits clarify the factors involved in the extent of species occurrence and shed light on the limits to adaptation. We studied the effects of elevational variation on the thermal dependence of fitness-related traits (incubation time, hatching rate, and survivorship, size, and condition of hatchlings) to assess the role of incubation requirements in distribution range limits of the alpine endemic Iberolacerta cyreni. We captured gravid females from two core (summit) and two marginal (low-elevation edge) populations, we incubated their eggs at three temperatures (22, 26, and 30 degrees C), and we monitored phenotypic effects. Viability of eggs and hatchlings decreased, independently of elevation, as incubation temperature increased. Hatching success and embryo survivorship were lower for clutches from low-elevation areas than for those from mountain summits, showing that lizards face difficulties thriving at the low-elevation edge of their range. Such difficulties were partly counterbalanced by faster postnatal growth at lower elevations, leading to increased adult size and higher fecundity. High incubation temperature had detrimental effects also at low-elevation areas, and no elevational variation in the thermal dependence of hatchling traits was detected. We suggest that temperature effects on egg development and the lack of selective pressures strong enough to foster local adaptation at marginal areas, combined with extended egg retention, may contribute to shape the range limits of these alpine oviparous reptiles.",Partially,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Incubation duration and hatching growth data not extracted because it is unclear if data from both sites were combined1674,Sari,"Sari, F; Kaska, Y",2016,Loggerhead Sea Turtle Hatchling Sex Ratio Differences Between Two Nesting Beaches In Turkey,Israel Journal of Ecology and Evolution,61,3-Apr,115-129,10.1080/15659801.2015.1047681,"Hatchling sex ratios of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) were estimated on two main nesting beaches (Dalyan Beach and Goksu Delta) in Turkey using three methods: nest temperature, incubation period and gonad histology.

The mean nest temperature in the middle third of the incubation period was calculated as 29.5 degrees C on Dalyan Beach and as 31 degrees C on Goksu Delta. Incubation periods on Dalyan Beach and Goksu Delta were found as 52.9 days and 50.4 days, respectively. Gonad histology method was used only on Dalyan Beach and it was determined that 235 (55.6%) hatchlings were female out of 423 histologically examined hatchlings. Using nest temperatures and incubation periods, sex ratios on Dalyan Beach were estimated as 61% and 69.3%, and on Goksu Delta as 81% and 73.1%, respectively. In light of our sex ratio results, Dalyan Beach has a relatively high proportion of male hatchlings possibly due to its relatively western location. Our findings indicate that Dalyan Beach is an important nesting beach for loggerhead sea turtles in the eastern Mediterranean not only in terms of nest numbers and hatching success but also for its high proportion of male hatchlings. As for the methods used in this study, for further studies, we can suggest that nest temperature method provides the most accurate sex ratio result compared with incubation period and gonad histology methods, if temperature-recorded nests are selected in a manner of representing temporal distribution of the total nests on study beach.",N,N,N,N,Y,N,N,N,Y,Natural nest study1675,Paredes,"Paredes, U; Radersma, R; Cannell, N; While, GM; Uller, T",2016,Low Incubation Temperature Induces Dna Hypomethylation In Lizard Brains,Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A - Ecological Genetics and Physiology,325,6,390-395,10.1002/jez.2024,"Developmental stress can have organizational effects on suites of physiological, morphological, and behavioral characteristics. In lizards, incubation temperature is perhaps the most significant environmental variable affecting embryonic development. Wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) recently introduced by humans from Italy to England experience stressfully cool incubation conditions, which we here show reduce growth and increase the incidence of scale malformations. Using a methylation-sensitive AFLP protocol optimized for vertebrates, we demonstrate that this low incubation temperature also causes hypomethylation of DNA in brain tissue. A consistent pattern across methylation-susceptible AFLP loci suggests that hypomethylation is a general response and not limited to certain CpG sites. The functional consequences of hypomethylation are unknown, but it could contribute to genome stability and regulation of gene expression. Further studies of the effects of incubation temperature on DNA methylation in ectotherm vertebrates may reveal mechanisms that explain why the embryonic thermal environment often has physiological and behavioral consequences for offspring.

Using two independently gathered data sets on veiled chameleons (Chamaeleo calyptratus), we show that a hatchling's sex is affected by the interaction between egg mass and incubation temperature. In both studies, larger eggs produced daughters at lower temperatures and sons at higher temperatures; however, the relationships between incubation temperature, egg mass, and sex diverged markedly between the two studies. The shift in egg-size effects was seen between 25 degrees C and 28 degrees C in one study and between 28 degrees C and 30 degrees C in the other. The links between offspring size, sex, and incubation temperature are not an artifact of differential mortality; in one of the studies, egg survival rates were uniformly high.

Although temperature is acentral feature of the environment forectotherms, its role in parental effects has been little explored until recently. Here, parental basking opportunity was manipulated in an oviparous lizard with temperature-dependent sex determination, the jacky dragon (Amphibolurus muricatus). Eggs were incubated at a temperature that typically produces a 50: 50 sex ratio, and hatchlings were reared in a standard thermal environment. Offspring of parents in short bask conditions appeared to have better fitness outcomes in captive conditions than those of parents in long bask conditions -they had greater growth and survival as a function of their mass. In addition, the sex of offspring (male or female) depended on the interaction between parental treatment and egg mass, and treatment impacted whether sons or daughters grew larger in their first season. The interactive effects of treatment on offspring sex and growth are consistent with adaptive explanations for the existence of temperature-dependent sex determination in this species. Moreover, the greater performance recorded in short bask offspring may represent an anticipatory parental effect to aid offspring in predicted conditions of restricted thermal opportunity.

One component of the developmental environment, which is likely central to early life oxidative stress among ectothermic and oviparous species, is that of temperature. We investigated how incubation temperature manipulations affect oxidative damage and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) hatchlings. First, to determine whether temperature fluctuations elicit oxidative stress, eggs from clutches were randomly assigned to either a constant (29.5 degrees C) or daily fluctuating temperature incubation (28.7 +/- 3 degrees C) treatment. Second, to assess the effect of temperature fluctuation frequency on oxidative stress, eggs were incubated in one of three fluctuating incubation regimes: 28.7 +/- 3 degrees C fluctuations every 12 h (hyper), 24 h (normal) or 48 h (hypo). Third, we tested the influence of average incubation temperature by incubating eggs in a daily fluctuating incubation temperature regime with a mean temperature of 26.5 degrees C (low), 27.1 degrees C (medium) or 27.7 degrees C (high). Although the accumulation of oxidative damage in hatchlings was unaffected by any thermal manipulation, TAC was affected by both temperature fluctuation frequency and average incubation temperature. Individuals incubated with a low frequency of temperature fluctuations had reduced TAC, while incubation at a lower average temperature was associated with enhanced TAC. These results indicate that although sufficient to prevent oxidative damage, TAC is influenced by developmental thermal environments, potentially because of temperature-mediated changes in metabolic rate. The observed differences in TAC may have important future consequences for hatchling fitness and overwinter survival.",N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,NA1679,Li,"Li, H; Holleley, CE; Elphick, M; Georges, A; Shine, R",2016,The Behavioural Consequences Of Sex Reversal In Dragons,Proceedings of the Royal Society B - Biological Sciences,283,1832,20160217,10.1098/rspb.2016.0217,"Sex differences in morphology, physiology, and behaviour are caused by sex-linked genes, as well as by circulating sex-steroid levels. Thus, a shift from genotypic to environmental sex determination may create an organism that exhibits a mixture of male-like and female-like traits. We studied a lizard species (Central Bearded Dragon, Pogona vitticeps), in which the high-temperature incubation of eggs transforms genetically male individuals into functional females. Although they are reproductively female, sex-reversed dragons (individuals with ZZ genotype reversed to female phenotype) resemble genetic males rather than females in morphology (relative tail length), general behaviour (boldness and activity level), and thermoregulatory tactics. Indeed, sex-reversed 'females' are more male-like in some behavioural traits than are genetic males. This novel phenotype may impose strong selection on the frequency of sex reversal within natural populations, facilitating rapid shifts in sex-determining systems. A single period of high incubation temperatures (generating thermally induced sex reversal) can produce functionally female individuals with male-like (or novel) traits that enhance individual fitness, allowing the new temperature-dependent sex-determining system to rapidly replace the previous genetically based one.",N,N,Y,N,N,N,N,N,Y,Data not provided for each incubation temperature treatment1680,van Lohuizen,"van Lohuizen, S; Rossendell, J; Mitchell, NJ; Thums, M",2016,The Effect Of Incubation Temperatures On Nest Success Of Flatback Sea Turtles (Natator Depressus),Marine Biology,163,7,1-Dec,10.1007/s00227-016-2917-8,"Oviparous species are threatened in a warming world if their nesting distribution does not change or if they cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions.

We observed that mean nest temperature was only different among nests, while daily thermal fluctuations vary depending on the depth position within the nest chamber, years and nests. The constant temperature equivalent was different among and within nests, but not among survey years.

However, the mechanisms that give rise to this behavioral variation are often unclear. This study investigated the influence of environmental manipulations during development on behavioral variation in hatchlings of the red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). First, we examined the effects of three manipulations during incubation (estrone sulfate exposure, corticosterone exposure, and thermal fluctuations) on hatchling righting response and exploration. Second, we determined whether hatchlings showed consistent differences (i.e. behavioral types) in their righting response and exploration across days and months, and whether these behaviors were correlated with one another. Finally, we examined whether righting response was predictive of ecologically relevant behaviors such as habitat choice and dispersal. Hatchling behavior was robust to our early manipulations; none of the pre-hatch treatments affected later behavior. There were significant clutch effects, which due to the split-clutch design suggests genetic underpinnings and/or maternal effects. We found evidence for behavioral types in turtles; both righting response and exploration were strongly repeatable and these behaviors were positively correlated. Righting response was not predictive of dispersal ability in the field, necessitating a revision in the general interpretations of righting response as a proxy for dispersal ability in turtles. Thus, turtle hatchlings show consistent behavioral differences that are robust to early developmental manipulations, and while not necessarily predictive of dispersal, these behavioral types can have important consequences throughout ontogeny.
